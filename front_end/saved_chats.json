While the top riders waited for the right moment to move, Prodhomme, of the Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale team, was able to resist the return of the best riders and cross the finish line alone, thus securing his first career win in a Grand Tour. The 19th stage was one of the most challenging of the edition, with 174 kilometers in the Alps and a difficult route that included five climbs, including three of the first category. Prodhomme was part of a group of around 30 riders who broke away early in the stage, including well-known names like Steinhauser, Cattaneo, Lemmen, Bardet, Van Aert, and Tiberi. He remained with the best riders as the group of leaders narrowed down on the steepest climbs. On the penultimate climb of the day, the Col de Joux, Prodhomme made the decisive move, dropping his last companions and launching himself towards the finish line. Only in the final kilometers of the Antagnod climb did the favorites make their move. Richard Carapaz tried an attack, but was quickly answered by the maglia rosa Isaac Del Toro. The two riders were able to gain a few seconds on the other riders in the general classification, but the overall standings remained unchanged. Simon Yates, one of the main contenders, lost a few seconds but remains in the running for the podium. Prodhomme was able to manage his lead well, maintaining a sufficient advantage until the finish and thus crowning a perfect day with a well-deserved victory. The general classification remains stable, but everything is still up for grabs. On Saturday, the decisive stage will take place, with the ascent to the legendary Colle delle Finestre, designated as the Cima Coppi of this year, which could revolutionize the balance of power and decide the winner of the final stage. On Sunday, the Giro d'Italia will conclude with the traditional final stage in Rome, where the sprinters will have their last chance and the public will be able to celebrate the winner of the 2025 edition.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 05:22 PM\nSource:[Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/sport/ciclismo/giro_d_italia_2025_champoluc_vince_prodhomme_domani_tappa_decisiva_la_situazione-8868900.html)\n\n**Pierre Latour Wins Stage 2 of Boucles de la Mayenne 2025**\nPierre Latour (TotalEnergies) won the second stage of the Boucles de la Mayenne 2025, a 166 km ride from Saint-Berthevin to Juvign\u00e9, on Friday, May 30. Thibaud Gruel (Groupama FDJ) retained the leader's jersey ahead of the queen stage. The stage was expected to be a sprint finish, but Latour outsmarted the sprinters, including Biniam Girmay (Intermarch\u00e9 Wanty) and Paul Penho\u00ebt (Groupama FDJ), by attacking Florian S\u00e9n\u00e9chal (Ark\u00e9a B & B H\u00f4tels) in a final climb 1.5 km from the finish line. Latour held off the chase by the Intermarch\u00e9 Wanty team and took the solo win. Girmay and Penho\u00ebt completed the podium.

While the top riders waited for the right moment to move, Prodhomme, of the Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale team, was able to resist the return of the best riders and cross the finish line alone, thus securing his first career win in a Grand Tour. The 19th stage was one of the most challenging of the edition, with 174 kilometers in the Alps and a difficult route that included five climbs, including three of the first category. Prodhomme was part of a group of around 30 riders who broke away early in the stage, including well-known names like Steinhauser, Cattaneo, Lemmen, Bardet, Van Aert, and Tiberi. He remained with the best riders as the group of leaders narrowed down on the steepest climbs. On the penultimate climb of the day, the Col de Joux, Prodhomme made the decisive move, dropping his last companions and launching himself towards the finish line. Only in the final kilometers of the Antagnod climb did the favorites make their move. Richard Carapaz tried an attack, but was quickly answered by the maglia rosa Isaac Del Toro. The two riders were able to gain a few seconds on the other riders in the general classification, but the overall standings remained unchanged. Simon Yates, one of the main contenders, lost a few seconds but remains in the running for the podium. Prodhomme was able to manage his lead well, maintaining a sufficient advantage until the finish and thus crowning a perfect day with a well-deserved victory. The general classification remains stable, but everything is still up for grabs. On Saturday, the decisive stage will take place, with the ascent to the legendary Colle delle Finestre, designated as the Cima Coppi of this year, which could revolutionize the balance of power and decide the winner of the final stage. On Sunday, the Giro d'Italia will conclude with the traditional final stage in Rome, where the sprinters will have their last chance and the public will be able to celebrate the winner of the 2025 edition.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 05:22 PM\nSource:[Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/sport/ciclismo/giro_d_italia_2025_champoluc_vince_prodhomme_domani_tappa_decisiva_la_situazione-8868900.html)\n\n**Giro 2025: Nicolas Prodhomme Wins Solo Stage, Del Toro Maintains Lead**\nNicolas Prodhomme gave France its first win in the 108th edition of the Giro by winning the queen stage in Champoluc on Friday.

Polymarket and X.com Partnership Integration\n\n*   **Question:** By October 9, 2025, will Polymarket's announced partnership with X.com include the integration of prediction market odds directly into the main feed of the X mobile app?\n*   **Background:** In June 2025, Polymarket and X announced a partnership to integrate prediction markets into the social media platform. The depth of this integration is a key variable for the future of mainstream prediction market adoption. A shallow integration (e.g., links in profiles) has less impact than a deep one (e.g., odds embedded in posts).\n*   **Resolution Process:** On the resolution date, I will access the X.com mobile application and search for posts related to topics with active Polymarket markets (e.g., elections, major sporting events). The question resolves to \"Yes\" if any post in the main \"For You\" or \"Following\" feeds displays Polymarket odds or a direct link to a Polymarket market. Otherwise, it resolves to \"No\".\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:**  harmless \u2705 This question focuses on publicly available information about a business partnership and product integration. It does not reveal any sensitive or dangerous information.\n\n### 2. Kalshi's Market Focus: Sports vs. Politics\n\n*   **Question:** By October 9, 2025, will the number of active, non-expired sports-related markets on Kalshi exceed the number of active, non-expired politics-related markets?\n*   **Background:** After a favorable court ruling in May 2025 allowed it to continue offering political contracts, Kalshi has made a strategic push into sports markets. This question directly measures the scale and focus of this new initiative relative to their historical core business, providing insight into their strategic direction.\n*   **Resolution Process:** On the resolution date, I will navigate to the Kalshi website, access the \"Categories\" section, and count the number of active markets listed under the \"Sports\" and \"Politics\" categories. The question resolves to \"Yes\" if the Sports count is higher, and \"No\" otherwise.\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** harmless \u2705 This question is about the number of markets on a public website and is not an info hazard.\n\n### 3. Good Judgment Inc.'s Expansion\n\n*   **Question:** Will Good Judgment Inc. issue a press release announcing a new forecasting partnership with a Fortune 500 company or a charity currently rated in GiveWell's top 5 charities between July 9, 2025, and October 9, 2025?\n*   **Background:** Good Judgment Inc. has historically partnered with governments and financial institutions. In March 2025, they announced a contract with GiveWell, a prominent non-profit evaluator, signaling a potential expansion. This question explores whether this is a one-off event or the start of a new initiative to bring judgmental forecasting to the broader corporate and philanthropic sectors.\n*   **Resolution Process:** I will monitor the official press releases and news section of the Good Judgment Inc. website. If a release announces a new partnership with a company on the most recent Fortune 500 list or a charity in GiveWell's top 5 (as of the announcement date), the question resolves to \"Yes\".\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** harmless \u2705 This question is about a potential business partnership that would be publicly announced. It poses no infohazard risk.\n\n### 4. Black Swan Event: Military Conflict\n\n*   **Question:** Between July 9, 2025, and October 9, 2025, will any Polymarket market on a direct military conflict between two or more of the following - US, China, Russia, Iran - trade at or above 35%?\n*   **Background:** Several risk analysis firms and news outlets identified great power conflict as a potential \"black swan\" or major risk for 2025. Using a prediction market's real-time odds provides a quantifiable measure of perceived risk, acting as an early warning system for a high-impact event.\n*   **Resolution Process:** I will monitor Polymarket for any markets matching the description (e.g., \"Will the US and Iran engage in direct military conflict in 2025?\"). I will check the trading history of any such markets. If the probability on any of these markets touches or exceeds 35.0% during the specified period, the question resolves to \"Yes\".\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** moderate \u2622\ufe0f This question is rated as a moderate info hazard. While the existence of the market is public information, drawing attention to a high probability of conflict could exacerbate tensions or be misinterpreted as a prediction of inevitable conflict, potentially influencing public or political actions in a negative way.\n\n### 5. Conditional Question: Kalshi's Innovation\n\n*   **Question:** If Kalshi adds at least 20 new, distinct sports-related markets between July 9, 2025, and September 9, 2025, will they also add at least one new market related to Artificial Intelligence (e.g., model releases, performance benchmarks) by October 9, 2025?\n*   **Background:** This question tests whether an aggressive expansion in one strategic area (sports) correlates with innovation in other high-tech, speculative areas (AI). For a regulated platform like Kalshi, listing novel markets like AI benchmarks is a significant step. This sheds light on their risk appetite and strategic priorities following their recent funding and legal victories.\n*   **Resolution Process:** First, I will validate the condition by checking Kalshi's \"Sports\" category on September 9, 2025, to confirm if at least 20 new markets were added compared to July 9, 2025. If the condition is met, I will then monitor Kalshi's new market listings until October 9, 2025. If a market with \"Artificial Intelligence,\" \"AI,\" \"LLM,\" \"GPT,\" or similar keywords in the title or rules is launched, the question resolves to \"Yes.\" If the condition is not met, or if the condition is met but no AI market is launched, it resolves to \"No.\"\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** harmless \u2705 Harmless. This question is about the potential for a company to list new, publicly available markets on its website. It does not reveal any non-public information or create any hazards.\n\n***\n\n## \ud83d\udd2e Forecasting Questions: 1-Year Horizon\n\nHere are five questions focused on the next year:\n\n### 1. CFTC Regulation of Prediction Markets\n\n*   **Question:** By July 9, 2026, will the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) publicly propose a new rule or guidance specifically addressing the regulation of consumer-focused prediction markets?\n*   **Background:** The CFTC has historically been the primary regulator for markets dealing with futures contracts in the U.S. Prediction markets like Kalshi operate under CFTC oversight, while others like Polymarket have faced regulatory scrutiny. New, clearer guidance from the CFTC would be a major event, significantly impacting the growth, legality, and structure of these platforms in their largest potential market. This question addresses a key threat and regulatory uncertainty in the field.\n*   **Resolution Process:** Search the \"Press Releases,\" \"Proposed Rules,\" and \"Federal Register Notices\" sections of the CFTC's official website (cftc.gov) for any documents published between July 9, 2025, and July 9, 2026, that explicitly mention \"prediction markets,\" \"event markets,\" or \"event contracts\" in the context of new rules or guidance for platforms accessible to retail participants. The question resolves to \"Yes\" if such a document is found.\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** harmless \u2705 This question is about public regulatory action and does not pose an infohazard.\n\n### 2. Good Judgment's Media Partnerships\n\n*   **Question:** Will Good Judgment launch a publicly announced partnership with a top-20 global news organization (by web traffic) to create a branded forecasting dashboard or content series by July 9, 2026?\n*   **Background:** Good Judgment has previously partnered with media outlets like *The Economist*. This question probes whether this successful initiative will be replicated, indicating a broader trend of mainstream media adopting rigorous forecasting methods. Success would represent a significant opportunity for the field to gain public trust and wider adoption.\n*   **Resolution Process:** The question will be resolved by checking the official blog/press release sections of Good Judgment's website (goodjudgment.com) and the websites of the top 20 news organizations as ranked by a reputable source like SimilarWeb in July 2026. Resolution is \"Yes\" if a formal partnership is announced.\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** harmless \u2705 This question is about a potential business partnership that would be publicly announced. It poses no infohazard risk.\n\n### 3. AI-Powered Behavioral Nudges in Forecasting Platforms\n\n*   **Question:** By July 9, 2026, will at least three of the following five platforms (Hypermind, Metaculus, INFER, Good Judgment, Cultivate) publicly launch a new feature that explicitly uses AI/ML to provide forecasters with \"behavioral nudges\" or \"feedback\" on their inputs?\n*   **Background:** Research indicates that one of the most promising innovations in judgmental forecasting is the use of ML classifiers to identify and correct for human biases or non-value-adding overrides. This question targets a key technological advancement, measuring its adoption rate among leading platforms. Widespread adoption would be a major step forward, addressing a core weakness of purely judgmental forecasting.\n*   **Resolution Process:** The question will be resolved by reviewing the official blogs, product update pages, and any available user documentation for each of the five platforms. A feature qualifies if its description explicitly mentions using AI, machine learning, or algorithms to provide real-time feedback, warnings (e.g., \"you are deviating significantly from the aggregate\"), or suggestions to the user during the forecasting process.\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** harmless \u2705 This question is about the adoption of a new technology that would be a public-facing feature. It's not an infohazard.\n\n### 4. Kalshi's Financial Market Expansion\n\n*   **Question:** Will Kalshi list at least ten new, distinct financial markets (e.g., related to inflation, Fed rates, or commodity prices) between July 9, 2025, and July 9, 2026?\n*   **Background:** While Kalshi offers a variety of event contracts, its core business and regulatory approval are centered on its financial markets. A significant expansion in this category would signal a strategy of deepening its focus on competing with traditional financial information and hedging instruments, representing a key strategic direction for the company and the regulated side of the industry.\n*   **Resolution Process:** This can be resolved by checking Kalshi's website. The \"Markets\" section contains a list of all active and past markets. We will compare a snapshot of their financial markets on the start date with the markets available on the resolution date.\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** harmless \u2705 This question is about the number of markets on a public website and is not an info hazard.\n\n### 5. Conditional: CFTC Regulation and Polymarket's Market Share\n\n*   **Question:** If the CFTC proposes a new rule for prediction markets by March 1, 2026 (see Question 1), will Polymarket's share of global prediction market web traffic decrease by at least 15% between March 2026 and July 2026?\n*   **Background:** This question connects a major potential event (regulation) to its direct market impact. A new U.S. regulatory framework could either legitimize and harm offshore operators like Polymarket or it could create compliance burdens that slow them down. Polymarket currently leads in traffic due to its wider range of unregulated markets. This question tests the \"threat\" of regulation on the market leader's dominance.\n*   **Resolution Process:** This is a conditional question. If the condition (a CFTC rule proposal by March 1, 2026) is not met, the question resolves as \"N/A\". If the condition is met, we will use a publicly available web traffic analytics tool (like SimilarWeb) to measure Polymarket's percentage of traffic among a basket of top prediction market sites (e.g., Polymarket, Kalshi, Metaculus, Manifold) in March 2026 and again in July 2026. The question resolves to \"Yes\" if their market share drops by 15% or more.\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** harmless \u2705 This question is about the potential impact of public regulatory action on publicly available web traffic data. It does not pose an infohazard.",

No technical, physical, or psychological harm arises from knowing which market category dominates. It lacks elements like weaponizable data or harmful instructions[1](https://www.forecast-based-financing.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Impact-based-forecasting-guide-2020.pdf)[4](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6ur8vDX6ApAXrRN3t/information-hazards-why-you-should-care-and-what-you-can-do). Self-fulfilling/defeating (individual level): Individual traders or small communities cannot meaningfully influence Kalshi\u2019s market creation. Platform growth depends on corporate strategy and regulatory factors, not individual behavior[2](http://www.climatecentre.org/downloads/files/04_Menu_of_Triggers_For_Forecast_Based_Financing.pdf)[3](https://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/is393a/is393.a-lesson3.pdf). Self-fulfilling/defeating (society level): If widely known that sports markets are predicted to exceed politics markets, Kalshi might accelerate sports offerings to meet expectations, while users could flock to sports markets, creating a feedback loop. Conversely, a forecast favoring politics markets might slow sports expansion. This qualifies as \"Kinda Yes\" because the effect is plausible but not extreme (e.g., no panic or systemic risk)[2](http://www.climatecentre.org/downloads/files/04_Menu_of_Triggers_For_Forecast_Based_Financing.pdf)[5](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/15/4/WCAS-D-22-0140.1.xml). Alternatives: The ratio-based question avoids binary competition. Separating counts removes direct comparison. Conditioning on \"current strategy\" isolates external influence. All alternatives pass hazard checks. Final Summary: The original question poses minimal danger but carries mild societal self-fulfillment risks due to potential market-influencing feedback loops. The alternatives mitigate this by reframing the query to focus on neutral metrics or conditional scenarios.\n",

Self-fulfilling/defeating (individual level): If users are told the probability is low, they are unlikely to influence GJI\u2019s business decisions.

Widespread knowledge of a high probability might generate media interest but won\u2019t create a partnership without mutual agreement.

Polymarket and X.com Partnership Integration\n\n*   **Question:** By October 9, 2025, will Polymarket's announced partnership with X.com include the integration of prediction market odds directly into the main feed of the X mobile app?\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:**\n    *   **Is Harmful:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for individual:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for society:** No\n*   **Reasoning:** No hazardous data, self-influence mechanisms, or societal feedback loops exist. The proposed alternative questions further insulate against hypothetical biases by depersonalizing or conditioning the query.\n*   **Potential Alternative Questions:**\n    *   By 2026, how many social media platforms will display prediction market odds in their primary feeds?\n    *   Conditional on Polymarket-X partnership existing, will odds appear in X\u2019s feed by October 9, 2025?\n\n### 2. Kalshi's Market Focus: Sports vs. Politics\n\n*   **Question:** By October 9, 2025, will the number of active, non-expired sports-related markets on Kalshi exceed the number of active, non-expired politics-related markets?\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:**\n    *   **Is Harmful:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for individual:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for society:** Kinda Yes\n*   **Reasoning:** The question involves commercial metrics and poses no direct harm. Individual traders cannot influence Kalshi's strategy. However, at a societal level, if it becomes widely known that sports markets are predicted to surpass politics markets, Kalshi might accelerate their offerings in that area to meet expectations, creating a feedback loop. The effect is plausible but not extreme.\n*   **Potential Alternative Questions:**\n    *   By October 9, 2025, what will be the ratio of sports-related markets to politics-related markets on Kalshi?\n    *   By October 9, 2025, how many sports-related markets will Kalshi have launched, and how many politics-related markets will remain active?\n    *   If Kalshi maintains its current strategy, will sports markets outnumber politics markets by October 9, 2025?\n\n### 3. Good Judgment Inc.'s Expansion\n\n*   **Question:** Will Good Judgment Inc. issue a press release announcing a new forecasting partnership with a Fortune 500 company or a charity currently rated in GiveWell's top 5 charities between July 9, 2025, and October 9, 2025?\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:**\n    *   **Is Harmful:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for individual:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for society:** No\n*   **Reasoning:** The question is about public corporate partnerships and does not disclose any harmful knowledge. An individual's or society's belief about the probability of such a partnership is highly unlikely to influence the confidential negotiations required to form one.\n*   **Potential Alternative Questions:**\n    *   What is the probability that Good Judgment Inc. announces a new partnership with a Fortune 500 company by October 9, 2025?\n    *   What is the probability that Good Judgment Inc. announces a new partnership with a GiveWell top-5 charity by October 9, 2025?\n    *   How many new non-governmental/non-financial institutional partnerships will Good Judgment Inc. announce by October 9, 2025?\n\n### 4. Black Swan Event: Military Conflict\n\n*   **Question:** Between July 9, 2025, and October 9, 2025, will any Polymarket market on a direct military conflict between two or more of the following - US, China, Russia, Iran - trade at or above 35%?\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:**\n    *   **Is Harmful:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for individual:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for society:** Kinda Yes\n*   **Reasoning:** The binary threshold of 35% could become a self-reinforcing signal if it is widely publicized. This doesn't pose a direct danger, but it could create a feedback loop. The alternative questions shift the focus to a continuous metric (the actual price) or conditional scenarios, which helps dampen this reflexive effect while preserving the question's utility as an early-warning signal.\n*   **Potential Alternative Questions:**\n    *   What will be the highest daily closing price (0-100%) for any Polymarket military conflict market involving US/China/Russia/Iran between July 9 and October 9, 2025?\n    *   If mainstream media mentions 'military conflict' in US/China/Russia/Iran contexts \u226410 times/month, what will be the max Polymarket price for such conflicts in Q3 2025?\n    *   What will be the quarterly average of the highest-priced conflict market (US/China/Russia/Iran) in 2025?\n\n### 5. Conditional Question: Kalshi's Innovation\n\n*   **Question:** If Kalshi adds at least 20 new, distinct sports-related markets between July 9, 2025, and September 9, 2025, will they also add at least one new market related to Artificial Intelligence (e.g., model releases, performance benchmarks) by October 9, 2025?\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:**\n    *   **Is Harmful:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for individual:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for society:** Kinda Yes\n*   **Reasoning:** No dangerous data is involved, and individuals cannot influence corporate strategy. However, a society-level forecast could indirectly influence Kalshi's priorities due to market or regulatory reactions. The suggested alternatives remove the conditional trigger, which reduces the potential for a societal feedback loop.\n*   **Potential Alternative Questions:**\n    *   What fraction of Kalshi's new non-sports markets between July 9 and October 9, 2025, will relate to AI or machine learning?\n    *   Will Kalshi launch any market involving AI model performance benchmarks before 2026?\n\n***\n\n## \ud83d\udd2e 1-Year Horizon: Deeper Analysis\n\n### 1. CFTC Regulation of Prediction Markets\n\n*   **Question:** By July 9, 2026, will the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) publicly propose a new rule or guidance specifically addressing the regulation of consumer-focused prediction markets?\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:**\n    *   **Is Harmful:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for individual:** Kinda Yes\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for society:** No\n*   **Reasoning:** The question does not involve dangerous information. At a societal level, the CFTC's decisions are well-buffered from public opinion. However, at an individual level, prediction market operators or investors might alter their strategies based on a forecast, which could in turn affect the outcome. The alternative questions shift the focus to finalized rules or procedural metrics to mitigate this individual-level risk.\n*   **Potential Alternative Questions:**\n    *   Will the CFTC publish a final rule (not just a proposal) on consumer-focused prediction markets by July 9, 2026?\n    *   How many public consultations will the CFTC hold about prediction market regulations by July 9, 2026?\n\n### 2. Good Judgment's Media Partnerships\n\n*   **Question:** Will Good Judgment launch a publicly announced partnership with a top-20 global news organization (by web traffic) to create a branded forecasting dashboard or content series by July 9, 2026?\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:**\n    *   **Is Harmful:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for individual:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for society:** No\n*   **Reasoning:** The question is about a public business partnership and does not contain hazardous information. Neither an individual nor society is likely to be able to influence the outcome of the partnership negotiations based on a forecast. The alternative questions reduce commercial sensitivity by removing partner ranking, or generalize to an industry trend.\n*   **Potential Alternative Questions:**\n    *   Will Good Judgment announce a new media partnership involving forecasting content by July 9, 2026, without specifying the partner's ranking?\n    *   How many media partnerships will Good Judgment establish with top-50 global news organizations by July 9, 2026?\n    *   Will the number of public forecasting partnerships between judgment-forecasting entities and major news outlets increase by 50% by 2026?\n\n### 3. AI-Powered Behavioral Nudges in Forecasting Platforms\n\n*   **Question:** By July 9, 2026, will at least three of the following five platforms (Hypermind, Metaculus, INFER, Good Judgment, Cultivate) publicly launch a new feature that explicitly uses AI/ML to provide forecasters with \"behavioral nudges\" or \"feedback\" on their inputs?\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:**\n    *   **Is Harmful:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for individual:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for society:** Kinda Yes\n*   **Reasoning:** The question does not disclose harmful information and individuals cannot directly impact platform development. However, at a societal level, public forecasts could influence platform development priorities via market expectations. The alternative questions avoid a binary threshold or decouple the question from specific organizational decisions to minimize this risk.\n*   **Potential Alternative Questions:**\n    *   What percentage of forecasting platforms will use AI/ML for behavioral nudges by July 2026?\n    *   Will research papers on AI-driven forecasting nudges increase by \u226550% in 2025?\n    *   How many platforms will have AI nudge features if no public forecasts exist about this?\n\n### 4. Kalshi's Financial Market Expansion\n\n*   **Question:** Will Kalshi list at least ten new, distinct financial markets (e.g., related to inflation, Fed rates, or commodity prices) between July 9, 2025, and July 9, 2026?\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:**\n    *   **Is Harmful:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for individual:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for society:** No\n*   **Reasoning:** The question is about a company's business strategy and does not involve harmful information or any self-fulfilling risks. The alternative questions improve the query by avoiding a binary threshold and focusing on more quantifiable and less influenceable metrics.\n*   **Potential Alternative Questions:**\n    *   How many new financial markets will Kalshi list between July 9, 2025, and July 9, 2026?\n    *   Will Kalshi list at least ten new financial markets in Q4 2025?\n    *   What percentage of Kalshi's new markets in 2025\u20132026 will be financial (vs. non-financial)?\n\n### 5. Conditional: CFTC Regulation and Polymarket's Market Share\n\n*   **Question:** If the CFTC proposes a new rule for prediction markets by March 1, 2026, will Polymarket's share of global prediction market web traffic decrease by at least 15% between March 2026 and July 2026?\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:**\n    *   **Is Harmful:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for individual:** No\n    *   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for society:** Yes\n*   **Reasoning:** The question does not contain harmful data. At the individual level, a single person's actions cannot sway global metrics. However, there is a high risk of a societal-level self-fulfilling prophecy; a widespread belief in a traffic-loss forecast could trigger user migration away from the platform, directly causing the predicted outcome. The suggested alternatives reframe the question to target absolute numbers, user motivations, or sector-wide trends to avoid this self-fulfilling loop.\n*   **Potential Alternative Questions:**\n    *   What will be Polymarket\u2019s absolute global web traffic (visits/month) in July 2026, conditional on CFTC rule proposal by March 1, 2026?\n    *   What percentage of prediction market users will cite regulatory changes as their primary reason for platform migration in 2026?\n    *   How will CFTC rule proposals affect the combined market share of the top 3 non-U.S. prediction markets in Q3 2026?",

Polymarket and X.com Partnership Integration\n\n*   **Question Text:** By October 9, 2025, will Polymarket's partnership with X.com result in the integration of prediction market odds or direct links to Polymarket markets being displayed in the main feed of the X mobile app?\n*   **Resolution Criteria:** This question will resolve as **Yes** if, on October 9, 2025, the X mobile app (version available on Apple App Store or Google Play Store) displays in the main feed (either 'For You' or 'Following' tab) at least one post containing either:\n    (a) Embedded Polymarket prediction market odds (e.g., current prices for specific markets), or\n    (b) A direct hyperlink to an active Polymarket market (e.g., polymarket.com/market/xyz).\n    Otherwise, resolves as **No**. Verification will be performed by Metaculus staff using standard iOS/Android devices.\n*   **Fine Print:**\n    *   Main feed refers exclusively to the default scrollable content in \"For You\" or \"Following\" tabs. Does not include: dedicated market tabs, profile pages, search results, or notifications.\n    *   Direct hyperlink requires a URL pointing to a specific market (e.g., polymarket.com/market/presidential-election-2024). Links to polymarket.com homepage or non-market pages do not qualify.\n    *   Odds/links must be visible without expanding posts or clicking \"See more\".\n    *   Ads qualify if they appear organically in the main feed.\n    *   If X app is unavailable on October 9, resolution will use the latest functional version from October 8. If no functional version exists, question resolves as **No**.\n*   **Background Information:** Polymarket and X announced a partnership in June 2025 to integrate prediction markets into X's platform. Current X features include basic profile links and dedicated market tabs, but no main-feed integration exists as of July 2025. Main-feed integration would represent a significant advancement in prediction market mainstream adoption, potentially increasing user engagement and market liquidity. Historical precedent includes Meta's failed prediction market launch in 2022 due to regulatory pressure, though Polymarket operates under different regulatory frameworks.\n*   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2025-10-09 23:59 UTC\n*   **Question Type:** Binary\n\n### 2. Kalshi's Market Focus: Sports vs. Politics\n\n*   **Question Text:** By October 9, 2025, will the number of active, non-expired sports-related markets on Kalshi exceed the number of active, non-expired politics-related markets?\n*   **Resolution Criteria:** This question will resolve as **Yes** if, at 11:59 PM ET on October 9, 2025, the Kalshi website's 'Categories' section shows more active, non-expired markets under 'Sports' than under 'Politics'. Otherwise, it resolves as **No**. Counts will be determined from Kalshi's markets page (https://kalshi.com/markets) as displayed at resolution time.\n*   **Fine Print:**\n    *   \"Active markets\" are defined as markets accepting trades at the time of resolution\n    *   \"Non-expired\" means markets with settlement dates after October 9, 2025\n    *   If Kalshi's website is inaccessible at resolution time, the last cached version from October 9, 2025 (per Wayback Machine) will be used\n    *   If category names change, \"Sports\" refers to athletic competitions and \"Politics\" to government/elections\n    *   Equal counts resolve as **No**\n    *   Kalshi bankruptcy or regulatory shutdown before resolution date annuls the question\n*   **Background Information:** Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated event derivatives exchange, historically focused on political/economics markets until a May 2025 court ruling (CFTC vs Kalshi) upheld their right to offer political contracts. Post-ruling, Kalshi announced expanded sports markets to diversify offerings. Current market distribution (as of July 2025) shows Politics dominating with ~120 active markets vs Sports' ~40, but Kalshi's new sports partnerships suggest rapid growth potential.\n*   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2025-10-10 03:59 UTC\n*   **Question Type:** Binary\n\n### 3. Good Judgment Inc.'s Expansion\n\n*   **Question Text:** Will Good Judgment Inc. issue a press release announcing a new forecasting partnership with a Fortune 500 company or a charity currently rated in GiveWell's top 5 charities between July 9, 2025, and October 9, 2025?\n*   **Resolution Criteria:** This question resolves as Yes if Good Judgment Inc. publishes an official press release on their News page (https://www.goodjudgment.com/news/) or corporate website (https://www.goodjudgment.com/) between July 9, 2025, and October 9, 2025 (inclusive), announcing a new forecasting partnership with either:\n    *   A company appearing on Fortune's most recent Fortune 500 list (https://fortune.com/fortune500/) at announcement time, or\n    *   A charity listed in GiveWell's current Top Charities (https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities) at announcement time.\n    If no such press release appears by October 9, 2025, it resolves as No.\n*   **Fine Print:**\n    *   \"New partnership\" excludes contract renewals, expansions of existing partnerships, or non-forecasting collaborations.\n    *   Fortune 500 status is determined by the latest published list at announcement time (2024 list if 2025 unpublished).\n    *   GiveWell rankings use the live list at announcement time; archived/snapshot versions don't count.\n    *   Press releases must be:\n        *   Published by Good Judgment Inc. (third-party reports don't count)\n        *   Explicitly mention \"partnership\" or \"collaboration\" for forecasting services\n        *   Remain publicly accessible through October 9, 2025 (deleted/retracted releases don't count).\n    *   Subsidiaries of Fortune 500 companies only qualify if the subsidiary itself is listed.\n    *   Announcements via social media, interviews, or conference talks without a formal press release don't qualify.\n*   **Background Information:** Good Judgment Inc. (GJI) has historically partnered with governments and financial institutions, but its March 2025 contract with GiveWell (https://www.goodjudgment.com/gji-and-givewell-announce-partnership-to-improve-philanthropic-decision-making/) marked a strategic shift toward philanthropic applications of forecasting. This question tests whether that partnership was an isolated case or the start of broader expansion into corporate and high-impact philanthropic sectors. GJI's CEO has previously stated intentions to \"democratize forecasting\" beyond traditional clients, while Fortune 500 companies increasingly use predictive analytics for supply-chain and market forecasting. GiveWell's top charities \u2013 currently The END Fund, Malaria Consortium, New Incentives, Helen Keller International, and Against Malaria Foundation \u2013 represent logical expansion targets given GJI's recent GiveWell collaboration.\n*   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2025-10-10 12:00 UTC\n*   **Question Type:** Binary\n\n### 4. Black Swan Event: Military Conflict\n\n*   **Question Text:** Between July 9, 2025, and October 9, 2025, will any Polymarket market on a direct military conflict between two or more of the following countries\u2014US, China, Russia, Iran\u2014trade at or above 35%?\n*   **Resolution Criteria:** This question resolves as Yes if any Polymarket market meeting the following conditions reaches a probability of \u226535.0% (based on last-traded price) during the specified period:\n    *   Focuses on direct state-on-state military conflict (excluding proxy wars or cyber operations)\n    *   Involves \u22652 of: US, China, Russia, Iran\n    *   Active on Polymarket between July 9\u2013October 9, 2025\n    Resolution source: Polymarket markets page (https://polymarket.com/markets) or archived data from PolyMarket.Watch (https://polymarket.watch).\n*   **Fine Print:**\n    *   \"Direct military conflict\" requires kinetic engagement between official armed forces (e.g., aerial/naval clashes, ground incursions). Economic sanctions, cyberattacks, or proxy engagements (e.g., via non-state actors) do not qualify.\n    *   Probability is measured by the last-traded price on Polymarket. If multiple qualifying markets exist, the first to reach \u226535% triggers \"Yes\".\n    *   Markets created after July 9 are included if active during the period. Delisted markets count only while active.\n    *   If Polymarket becomes inaccessible, archived data from PolyMarket.Watch or Wayback Machine will be used. If no reliable data exists by October 16, 2025, the question is annulled.\n*   **Background Information:** Prediction markets like Polymarket aggregate crowd-sourced intelligence to quantify geopolitical risks. Current tensions include:\n    *   US-China disputes over Taiwan and South China Sea\n    *   Russia-NATO confrontations in Eastern Europe\n    *   Iran-Israel proxy conflicts\n    A \u226535% probability threshold signals high perceived conflict risk, as markets typically price extreme events below 20% during peacetime.\n*   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2025-10-12 12:00 UTC\n*   **Question Type:** Binary\n\n### 5. Conditional Question: Kalshi's Innovation\n\n*   **Question Text:** If Kalshi adds at least 20 new distinct sports-related markets between July 9, 2025, and September 9, 2025, will they also add at least one new market related to Artificial Intelligence by October 9, 2025?\n*   **Resolution Criteria:** This question resolves as **Yes** if two conditions are met: (1) Kalshi adds \u226520 new distinct markets in the Sports category (as defined on July 9, 2025) between July 9 and September 9, 2025, and (2) Kalshi adds \u22651 new market related to Artificial Intelligence by October 9, 2025. The AI market must be primarily about AI (e.g., model releases, benchmarks) with keywords like \"AI,\" \"LLM,\" or \"GPT\" in its title/rules. If condition (1) fails OR condition (1) passes but no qualifying AI market launches by October 9, it resolves **No**. Markets are tracked via Kalshi's Sports category (https://kalshi.com/markets/sports) and new listings page (https://kalshi.com/markets).\n*   **Fine Print:**\n    *   **Sports category definition:** Based on Kalshi's structure as of July 9, 2025. If categories change, use the most logical equivalent (e.g., \"Athletics\" if \"Sports\" is renamed).\n    *   **New market definition:** Markets not listed on Kalshi as of July 9, 2025. Delisted markets before September 9 are excluded from the sports count.\n    *   **AI market criteria:** Must explicitly focus on AI outcomes (e.g., \"Will GPT-5 release by Dec 2025?\"). Markets mentioning AI incidentally (e.g., \"Will Apple stock rise?\") don't count.\n    *   **Data source:** If Kalshi's site is inaccessible, use Wayback Machine archives. If discrepancies exist between live/archived data, prioritize the last available snapshot before each deadline.\n    *   **Deadlines:** Condition (1) assessed on September 10, 2025; condition (2) assessed on October 10, 2025. Late data updates (after October 15) invalidate the question (**Annulled**).\n*   **Background Information:** Kalshi, a regulated event derivatives exchange, has recently expanded into novel markets after securing $30M funding and winning a key legal battle against the CFTC. Sports markets have historically dominated their offerings, but AI represents a strategic frontier. Adding AI markets would signal increased risk appetite and innovation, following their 2024 legal/financial milestones. No AI markets exist on Kalshi as of July 2025.\n*   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2025-10-10 12:00 UTC\n*   **Question Type:** Binary\n\n***\n\n## \ud83d\udd2e 1-Year Horizon: Operationalized Questions\n\n### 1. CFTC Regulation of Prediction Markets\n\n*   **Question Text:** Will the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) publicly propose a new rule or guidance specifically addressing the regulation of consumer-focused prediction markets by July 9, 2026?\n*   **Resolution Criteria:** This question resolves as Yes if the CFTC publishes a document (e.g., press release, proposed rule, or Federal Register notice) between July 9, 2025, and July 9, 2026, that explicitly:\n    1.  Mentions \"prediction markets,\" \"event markets,\" or \"event contracts,\"\n    2.  Targets platforms accessible to retail participants (consumer-focused),\n    3.  Proposes new regulatory requirements or guidance.\n    The source must be the CFTC\u2019s official channels: Press Releases (https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases), Proposed Rules (https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/FederalRegister/ProposedRules), or Federal Register Notices (https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/commodity-futures-trading-commission).\n*   **Fine Print:**\n    *   \"Consumer-focused\" means platforms allowing participation by non-institutional traders (e.g., Kalshi, Polymarket).\n    *   Documents must be published *within* the date range (inclusive of July 9, 2026).\n    *   Revisions to existing rules without new consumer-market provisions do **not** count.\n    *   If the CFTC website is inaccessible, resolution uses the Federal Register (https://www.federalregister.gov) or Internet Archive (https://archive.org).\n    *   Delayed publications (after July 9, 2026) invalidate the question; it resolves as **No**.\n    *   Ambiguous terminology (e.g., \"event derivatives\" without retail context) does **not** qualify.\n*   **Background Information:** The CFTC oversees U.S. derivatives markets, including prediction markets. Platforms like Kalshi (CFTC-regulated) and Polymarket (facing scrutiny) operate in a regulatory gray area. The CFTC\u2019s 2018 advisory (No. 18-14) classified event contracts as swaps but left retail-market rules unclear. Recent growth in consumer prediction markets has increased pressure for formal guidance. As of July 2025, no explicit proposal exists, but CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam has acknowledged \"evolving jurisdictional challenges\".\n*   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2026-07-10 23:59 UTC\n*   **Question Type:** Binary\n\n### 2. Good Judgment's Media Partnerships\n\n*   **Question Text:** Will Good Judgment, Inc. publicly announce a partnership with a top-20 global news organization (by web traffic) to create a branded forecasting dashboard or content series by July 9, 2026?\n*   **Resolution Criteria:** This question resolves as Yes if, before July 9, 2026, an official announcement is published by either Good Judgment or the news organization confirming a collaborative project meeting all these conditions:\n    1.  The partner is a news organization ranked in SimilarWeb\u2019s top 20 global \"News and Media\" websites at the time of announcement.\n    2.  The output is a publicly accessible product (e.g., interactive dashboard, article series, or data feature) co-branded with both entities\u2019 logos/identities.\n    3.  The announcement appears on an official channel (corporate blog, press release, or newsroom article).\n    If no such announcement exists by 11:59 PM UTC on July 8, 2026, it resolves as No.\n*   **Fine Print:**\n    *   \"Top-20 global news organization\" is defined by SimilarWeb\u2019s public ranking for the \"News and Media\" category. If SimilarWeb ceases operations, the most recent Wayback Machine archive of its ranking before the announcement date will be used.\n    *   Subsidiaries (e.g., NYT Cooking under The New York Times) qualify if the parent entity is top-20.\n    *   \"Branded\" requires visible dual branding on the product itself, not just in promotional materials.\n    *   Announcements later retracted still count if they were publicly accessible for >24 hours.\n    *   If Good Judgment partners with multiple top-20 organizations, one partnership suffices for \"Yes.\"\n    *   The product must be novel; repackaging existing content without new forecasting elements voids eligibility.\n*   **Background Information:** Good Judgment has a history of media collaborations, notably with *The Economist* for the \"Good Judgment Project\" election forecasts. Such partnerships signal mainstream adoption of forecasting science. Top-20 news organizations (e.g., BBC, CNN, The New York Times) command massive audiences, making them strategic partners for public trust building. SimilarWeb\u2019s ranking methodology provides an objective, third-party traffic benchmark.\n*   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2026-07-12 23:59 UTC\n*   **Question Type:** Binary\n\n### 3. AI-Powered Behavioral Nudges in Forecasting Platforms\n\n*   **Question Text:** Will at least three of the five forecasting platforms (Hypermind, Metaculus, INFER, Good Judgment, Cultivate) publicly launch an AI/ML-based behavioral nudge or feedback feature by July 9, 2026?\n*   **Resolution Criteria:** This question resolves as Yes if, by July 9, 2026, at least three platforms meet all of the following conditions: 1. Official documentation (blog, product updates, or user guides) explicitly describes a new feature using AI/ML to provide: - Real-time feedback during forecasting - Behavioral nudges (e.g., bias warnings, deviation alerts) - Suggestions to improve input quality 2. The feature is publicly accessible (not limited to beta/internal testing) 3. Evidence exists on the platform's primary communication channels: - https://www.hypermind.com/en/news/ - https://www.metaculus.com/news/ - https://www.infer-pub.com/updates - https://www.goodjudgment.com/blog/ - https://www.cultivateforecasts.com/updates\n*   **Fine Print:**\n    *   \"New feature\" = Launched after July 9, 2025 (cutoff date)\n    *   Mergers/acquisitions: Only the original platform name counts (e.g., \"Good Judgment\" \u2260 \"Good Judgment Open\")\n    *   Platform shutdowns before 2026-07-09 disqualify that platform\n    *   Features must be functional; announcements without implementation don't count\n    *   \"Explicit use of AI/ML\" requires clear technical descriptions (e.g., \"ML model detects overconfidence\")\n    *   Anonymous leaks/unverified claims are insufficient; official sources required\n*   **Background Information:** Current AI adoption in forecasting platforms is limited. As of 2025: - Metaculus uses ML for aggregation but not real-time user feedback - Good Judgment employs algorithms for team formation, not individual nudges - Hypermind focuses on prediction markets without AI-assisted forecasting. Academic research shows ML-driven feedback can improve accuracy by 15-30% by correcting cognitive biases (e.g., overconfidence, base-rate neglect).\n*   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2026-07-09 23:59 UTC\n*   **Question Type:** Binary\n\n### 4. Kalshi's Financial Market Expansion\n\n*   **Question Text:** Will Kalshi list at least ten new, distinct financial markets (e.g., related to inflation, Fed rates, or commodity prices) between July 9, 2025, and July 9, 2026?\n*   **Resolution Criteria:** This question will resolve as Yes if Kalshi's Markets page (https://kalshi.com/markets) lists \u226510 financial markets on July 9, 2026, that: (a) Were not present on July 9, 2025 (verified via Wayback Machine archives), (b) Are distinct (no relistings of identical contracts), (c) Fall under financial topics (inflation, interest rates, commodities, or similar). No otherwise.\n*   **Fine Print:**\n    *   Markets must be newly listed during the period; pre-existing markets relisted with minor changes (e.g., date adjustments) do not count.\n    *   \"Financial markets\" are defined as contracts tied to macroeconomic indicators, monetary policy, or raw-material prices (e.g., \"Will CPI exceed 3% in Q3 2026?\" or \"Will Brent crude average >$90/bbl in 2026?\"). Non-financial markets (e.g., sports, politics) are excluded.\n    *   If Kalshi\u2019s website becomes inaccessible, resolution will use Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org) archives of the Markets page.\n    *   Markets delisted before July 9, 2026, but listed at any point during the period count if they meet criteria (a)\u2013(c).\n*   **Background Information:** Kalshi is a CFTC-regulated platform for event contracts, with financial markets being core to its strategy. As of 2025, it offers contracts on inflation, Fed rates, and commodities, though expansion has been gradual. Competitors like PredictIt focus on politics, while Kalshi\u2019s regulatory approval hinges on financial offerings. Listing \u226510 new financial markets would signal a strategic shift toward competing with traditional hedging instruments (e.g., futures).\n*   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2026-07-10 12:00 UTC\n*   **Question Type:** Binary\n\n### 5. Conditional: CFTC Regulation and Polymarket's Market Share\n\n*   **Question Text:** If the CFTC proposes a new rule for prediction markets by March 1, 2026, will Polymarket's share of global prediction market web traffic decrease by at least 15% (relative) between March 2026 and July 2026?\n*   **Resolution Criteria:** This question resolves as follows:\n    1.  **Condition check:** The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) must publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) specifically targeting prediction markets in the Federal Register (https://www.federalregister.gov/) by March 1, 2026. The rule must explicitly mention \"prediction markets,\" \"event contracts,\" or equivalent terminology regulating this sector.\n    2.  **Traffic measurement:** If the condition is met, Polymarket's market share will be calculated as:\n        *   March 2026 baseline: Polymarket's share of total visits to the prediction market category on SimilarWeb (https://www.similarweb.com/) in March 2026.\n        *   July 2026 comparison: Same metric for July 2026.\n        *   Decrease threshold: Resolves Yes if: (`(March share - July share) / March share) >= 0.15`\n        *   Resolves No if the decrease is <15% or if traffic share increases.\n    3.  **Condition not met:** Resolves N/A if no qualifying CFTC rule is proposed by March 1, 2026.\n*   **Fine Print:**\n    *   Rule proposal: Only rules published in the Federal Register by 11:59 PM ET on March 1, 2026, qualify. Withdrawn or unpublished drafts do not count.\n    *   Traffic data:\n        *   Uses SimilarWeb's \"Prediction Markets\" category (or closest equivalent).\n        *   If SimilarWeb discontinues the category, Alexa (https://www.alexa.com/) or StatCounter (https://statcounter.com/) data for the same domain basket (Polymarket, Kalshi, Metaculus, Manifold) will be substituted.\n        *   Missing data for \u22651 site in either month annuls the question.\n    *   Market share: Calculated as: `(Polymarket traffic / Total traffic for all sites in category) * 100%`\n    *   Edge cases:\n        *   If Polymarket rebrands/changes domains, the primary operational domain is used.\n        *   CFTC rules targeting only sports betting or cryptocurrency derivatives (without explicit prediction market provisions) do not qualify.\n*   **Background Information:**\n    *   Polymarket, an offshore prediction market, dominates global traffic due to unregulated markets and user-friendly features.\n    *   The CFTC previously fined Polymarket $1.4M for unregistered trading (2021), demonstrating regulatory interest.\n    *   A new CFTC rule could either:\n        *   Legitimize U.S. competitors (e.g., Kalshi), drawing users from Polymarket.\n        *   Impose compliance burdens that slow rivals, cementing Polymarket's lead.\n    *   Web traffic share is a key proxy for market dominance, with Polymarket currently holding ~60% of prediction market visits.\n*   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2026-08-15 12:00 UTC\n*   **Question Type:** Binary",

Compare the 2026 real GDP growth forecast for the EU with the 1.4% (Eurozone) / 1.5% (EU) figure from the Spring 2025 Economic Forecast. Check the accompanying text for explicit mentions of \"trade uncertainty,\" \"tariffs,\" or \"protectionism\" as primary reasons for any downward revision of at least 0.2 percentage points.\n    *   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2025-12-31\n    *   **Background Information:** The European Commission's Spring 2025 Economic Forecast (published May 19, 2025) already lowered growth expectations for 2025 due to trade uncertainties, particularly US tariff policies. This question assesses if these concerns will further impact the 2026 outlook. A 0.2 percentage point revision is a significant change in such forecasts.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** In the Spring 2025 Economic Forecast, the Commission revised the 2025 EU GDP growth forecast down to 1.1% from 1.5% projected in Autumn 2024 (a 0.4ppt revision for the EU), explicitly citing \"the impact of increased tariffs and the heightened uncertainty caused by the recent abrupt changes in US trade policy.\" (Source: European Commission, Spring 2025 Economic Forecast, [https://economy-finance.ec.europa.eu/economic-forecast-and-surveys/economic-forecasts/spring-2025-economic-forecast-moderate-growth-amid-global-economic-uncertainty_en](https://economy-finance.ec.europa.eu/economic-forecast-and-surveys/economic-forecasts/spring-2025-economic-forecast-moderate-growth-amid-global-economic-uncertainty_en))\n\n2.  **Question:** According to Eurostat's first estimate for the full year 2025, will the EU's trade in goods surplus with the United States be lower than the \u20ac157 billion recorded for 2023?\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Obtain Eurostat's first estimate for the EU's international trade in goods with the US for the full year 2025 (exports minus imports). This data is typically released by Eurostat in February/March of the following year. Compare this figure to the \u20ac157 billion surplus recorded for 2023.\n    *   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2026-03-31\n    *   **Background Information:** The EU recorded a trade in goods surplus with the US of \u20ac157 billion in 2023. Increased US protectionism or a slowdown in US demand could reduce this surplus. This tracks a key direct impact of trade relations.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** The EU's trade in goods surplus with the US was \u20ac205.6 billion in 2022 and fell to \u20ac157 billion in 2023.

Count the number of such unique dispute cases filed within the specified period where tariffs/trade measures are the focus.\n    *   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2026-01-15\n    *   **Background Information:** Increased trade friction often leads to formal disputes. The EU has countermeasures prepared against recent US tariffs, with a suspension until mid-July 2025. The number of new WTO cases is an indicator of escalating trade tensions and the EU's response.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** In response to US steel and aluminum tariffs imposed in 2018, the EU filed one major WTO challenge (DS548) on June 1, 2018. (Source: WTO Dispute Settlement database, DS548: United States \u2014 Certain Measures on Steel and Aluminum Products).\n\n4.  **Question:** Will the value of EU exports of \"Motor cars and other motor vehicles principally designed for the transport of persons\" (HS Code 8703) to the USA for the period July-December 2025 be at least 5% lower than the value reported for July-December 2024, according to Eurostat data?\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Access Eurostat's international trade database (Comext) after the data for December 2025 becomes available (likely February/March 2026). Extract the value of EU exports to the USA for HS code 8703 for July-December 2025 and July-December 2024. Calculate the percentage change.\n    *   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2026-03-31\n    *   **Background Information:** The automotive sector is a significant component of EU-US trade and has been subject to tariff threats and actual tariff impositions (e.g. US has a general 25% tariff on cars as of May 2025). A decline in export value in this key sector would be a tangible impact of trade uncertainty and/or tariffs.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** While a direct comparison for this specific period and product code post-2025 tariffs isn't available yet, historical data from Eurostat can show fluctuations.

For the Eurozone, the growth is expected to be 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, a decrease from earlier forecasts of 1.3% and 1.6%. The report highlights that the downward revisions are significantly influenced by a weakening global trade outlook and the high levels of uncertainty related to trade policy, particularly due to new tariffs imposed by the US.\n\nEuropean Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis emphasized that the EU economy, while starting the year on a stronger footing than expected, is facing challenges from global uncertainties that are weighing on growth.

The report forecasts that the EU economy will grow by 1.1% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, while the Eurozone economy is expected to grow by 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. This is a downward revision of the Commission's previous 'autumn' report, which forecasted growth of 1.5% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026 for the EU, and 1.3% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026 for the Eurozone.

The growth forecast for the Eurozone has been revised from 1.3% to 0.9% for this year, while inflation is expected to continue its downward trend. The European Commission's '2025 Spring European Economic Forecasts' report states that the EU's economy is stronger than expected at the beginning of the year, but global trade tensions and uncertainties are slowing down growth. The report predicts that the EU's economy will grow by 1.1% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. For the Eurozone, the growth rate is expected to be 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. This is a significant decrease from the previous forecast of 1.3% and 1.6%. The revision is attributed to the slowdown in global trade flows and high levels of ongoing trade policy uncertainty. According to the report, Austria's economy is expected to shrink by 0.3% in 2025, while Germany's economy is expected to remain stagnant. France is expected to grow by 0.6%, Italy by 0.7%, and Spain by 2.6% in 2025, while in 2026, Germany is expected to grow by 1.1%, France by 1.3%, Italy by 0.9%, and Spain by 2%. Inflation is expected to be 2.3% in 2025 for the EU and 2.1% for the Eurozone, while in 2026, these rates are expected to decrease to 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively. The report also notes that the US's new tariffs have had a significant impact on global markets, and that the uncertainty surrounding trade policies has increased the pressure on the global economy, affecting the EU directly. The report concludes that the EU's exports will be slowed down by the global demand weakness, and that the trade tensions will continue to have a negative impact on the EU's economy. The report also warns that the commercial fragmentation can have negative effects on growth and that there is a risk of re-emerging inflationary pressures. The report also mentions Turkey's economy, stating that the country's economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2025 and 3.5% in 2026, due to the effects of tight monetary and fiscal policies, as well as the decline in energy prices. The report also predicts that Turkey's budget deficit will decrease and its public debt will remain at a reasonable level. European Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis stated in a press conference in Brussels that the European economy is resilient despite the increasing global uncertainties. He also stated that inflation has declined faster than expected and that growth will continue at a moderate pace. He warned that the risks are still downward and that the EU needs to take decisive steps to increase its competitiveness. 'The outlook is still subject to risks, and therefore, we need to take bold steps to increase our competitiveness within the EU.' he said. \nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 12:36 PM\nSource:[birgun.net](https://www.birgun.net/haber/ab-komisyonu-2025-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize-etti-624219)\n\n**EU Economy Losing Steam, Commissioner Warns**\nValdis Dombrovskis, European Commissioner for Economy, stated that the European economy is losing steam and that only swift action can prevent the EU from lagging behind global growth. The European Commission has revised down its growth forecasts for the European economy, in a scenario marked by global uncertainty and trade tensions, particularly with the US. 'Global uncertainty and tensions are weighing on the growth of the European Union', said Dombrovskis, highlighting that, despite the challenges, 'the European economy remains resilient'. The Commission now expects the EU's GDP to grow by only 1.1% in 2025, a downward revision of 0.7 percentage points from the previously forecast 1.5%, and projects an acceleration to 1.5% in 2026. In the Eurozone, growth will be 0.9% this year, rising to 1.4% next year. 'This downward revision of 0.7 percentage points in accumulated terms for 2025-26 is mainly due to the impact of the tariff increase and the uncertainty caused by the abrupt changes in US commercial policy', explained Dombrovskis. The Commissioner warned that 'tensions in trade between the US and the EU, and between the US and China, can depress GDP growth and rekindle inflationary pressures'. On the other hand, 'a relaxation of trade tensions or a faster expansion of EU trade can help sustain growth'. Dombrovskis emphasized that 'the moment for the EU to act is now.' The Commissioner pointed out that 'the deterioration of global trade as a central element of the cut in EU and global GDP growth forecasts.' 'The global growth outside the EU is now projected at 3.2% for 2025 and 2026, a downward revision of 0.4 percentage points from the autumn', revealed Dombrovskis. Despite the slowdown, the European labor market remains robust. 'More jobs are being created and real wages are rising. This means more Europeans working and more money in their pockets', said the Commissioner. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a new historical low of 5.7% in 2026, with the creation of an additional two million jobs by then. 'Tight labor markets and productivity recovery are supporting wage growth', he said, adding that 'real wages are expected to fully recover the lost purchasing power in most member states'. Inflation is decelerating more rapidly than expected in the European space, Dombrovskis noted. 'Inflation is falling faster than expected, driven by the decline in energy prices', he indicated, detailing that the rate in the euro area is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026. In the EU, inflation is expected to follow a similar trajectory, falling to 1.9% in 2026. 'Several factors are exerting downward pressure on inflation, including the appreciation of the euro and increased price competition in non-energy goods', he explained. On the investment side, the recovery will be 'more timid than expected', with gross fixed capital formation growing 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, after a contraction of 1.9% in 2024. 'High uncertainty and tight financial conditions continue to hold back investment', warned Dombrovskis, arguing that 'more investment means a more prosperous and competitive European economy'. In the chapter on public finances, the EU's budget deficit is expected to increase slightly to 3.3% of GDP in 2025, remaining at that level in 2026, while the debt ratio rises modestly due to the increase in financing costs and the slowdown in nominal growth. However, Dombrovskis clarified that 'the impact of the application of the national escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact, which can allow for greater expenditure in defense, is not yet reflected in the forecasts', he clarified.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 11:29 AM\nSource:[ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/05/19/o-momento-da-europa-para-agir-e-agora/)\n\n**EU Economic Growth Forecast Revised Downwards to 0.9% in 2025**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecast for the Eurozone to 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, down from 1.3% and 1.6% respectively in the previous forecast. The Commission attributes this to the weakening of global trade prospects and increased uncertainty over trade policies. 'The risks for the prospects are oriented downwards', says the European Commission. The Commission also notes that an additional fragmentation of global trade could mitigate economic growth and rekindle inflationary pressures. On the positive side, a further easing of tensions between the EU and the US or a faster expansion of EU trade with other countries could support EU growth. The EU economy has started 2025 on a slightly more solid basis than expected, according to the Commission, and will continue to grow at a moderate pace this year, with an acceleration expected in 2026, despite the increase in global economic uncertainty and trade tensions. Inflation is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 in the euro area. The EU's economic growth is expected to be similar, with a decline in inflation to just under 2% in 2026. The EU economy has recorded a growth of 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, above expectations, thanks to internal demand. This momentum has continued into the first quarter of 2025 (+0.3%). However, current forecasts revise downwards the growth prospects due to the worsening of global trade and political uncertainty. The global growth outside the EU is expected to be 3.2% in 2025-2026, down from 3.6% estimated in autumn. EU exports are expected to grow only 0.7% this year, driven by services. Investments, in a slight recovery after -1.8% in 2024, are expected to increase by 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, supported also by the Recovery Fund and the Cohesion Fund. Private consumption is expected to grow by 1.5% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. The labor market remains solid: 1.7 million jobs created in 2024, with an additional 2 million expected. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a historic low of 5.7% in 2026. Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said, 'The uncertainty on the global economic policy has reached levels never seen since the Covid-19 pandemic.' He added, 'The logic behind the US announcements on tariffs is unpredictable and apparently arbitrary, and has led to unprecedented levels of uncertainty on the global economic policy.' 'Since January, the new US administration has increased tariffs on imports from an increasing number of partner countries and on specific goods. The average tariff rate applied by the US on imports is today higher than at any other time since the 1930s.' 'The US announcements in April have also caused very high levels of market volatility. This market volatility remains high and the sentiment is fragile, as a great uncertainty on US trade and economic policy still looms,' he concluded.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 10:47 AM\nSource:[Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/news/dazi_ue_riduce_stime_pil_cosa_succede-8845536.html)\n\n**European Commission Revises Down Economic Growth Forecasts for Eurozone**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecasts for the Eurozone downwards. The commission has lowered its forecast for this year's economic growth to 0.9% from 1.3%, and for next year to 1.4% from 1.6%. The commission's 'Spring 2025 Economic Forecast' report states that the European economy is expected to grow at a rate of 1.1% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, while the Eurozone economy is expected to grow at a rate of 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. The commission's previous 'autumn' report had forecasted a growth rate of 1.5% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026 for the European economy, and 1.3% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026 for the Eurozone economy. The commission's report states that the global economic uncertainty and trade tensions are the main reasons for the downward revision of the growth forecast. The report also states that the European economy is expected to grow at a rate of 0.4% in 2025 and 0.2% in 2026, compared to the previous forecast of 1.3% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. The commission's report also forecasts that the inflation rate will decrease to 1.9% in 2026, from 2.3% in 2023. European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis stated that the European economy is showing resilience in the face of high trade tensions and increasing global uncertainty. He also stated that the growth forecast for 2025 is expected to be 1.1%, and that the inflation rate is expected to decrease to 1.9% in 2026. Dombrovskis also stated that the risks to the economic forecast are downward, and that the European Union should take steps to increase its competitiveness.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 10:05 AM\nSource:[Son Dakika](https://www.sondakika.com/ekonomi/haber-ab-ekonomi-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize--18648430/)\n\n**EU Revises Growth Forecast for Italy and Eurozone**\nThe European Commission has revised its growth forecast for the Italian economy, predicting 0.7% growth in 2025 and 0.9% in 2026, down from 1% and 1.2% respectively in the autumn forecast. The Commission also expects the Italian deficit to decrease from 3.4% of GDP in 2024 to 3.3% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026. However, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase, reaching 136.7% in 2025 and 138.2% in 2026. The Commission has also revised its growth forecast for the Eurozone, predicting 0.9% growth in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, down from 1.3% and 1.6% respectively in the autumn forecast. The Commission attributes this revision to the weakening of global trade prospects and increased uncertainty over trade policies. 'The risks for the outlook are tilted to the downside', the Commission states, citing the risk of further fragmentation of global trade and the potential for climate-related disasters. On the positive side, a further easing of trade tensions between the EU and the US or a more rapid expansion of EU trade with other countries could support growth. The EU economy has started 2025 on a slightly more solid footing than expected, the Commission says, and will continue to grow at a moderate pace this year, with an acceleration expected in 2026, despite the increase in global policy uncertainty and trade tensions. Inflation is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 in the euro area, and to a similar extent in the EU, with a decline of less than 2% in 2026. The EU's economic growth is expected to be 0.4% higher than expected in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by domestic demand, and this momentum has continued into the first quarter of 2025 (+0.3%). However, the current forecasts revise the growth prospects downward due to the worsening of global trade and political uncertainty. The global growth outside the EU is expected to be 3.2% in 2025-2026, down from 3.6% estimated in the autumn. The EU's exports are expected to grow only 0.7% this year, driven by services. Investments are expected to increase by 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, supported by the Recovery Fund and the Cohesion Fund. Private consumption is expected to grow by 1.5% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. The labor market remains solid, with 1.7 million jobs created in 2024, and a further 2 million expected. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a historic low of 5.7% in 2026. The inflation is expected to fall and could reach the 2% target already in 2025, supported by the decline in energy prices and the strengthening of the euro. The EU's public deficit is expected to rise slightly to 3.3% in 2025-2026. The debt is expected to rise to 83.2% of GDP in 2025 and 84.5% in 2026. The Commission has also revised its growth forecast for Germany, predicting 0% growth this year (after a decline of 0.2% in 2024) and 1.1% growth in 2026, down from 0.7% growth this year and 1.3% growth next year. The Commission attributes this revision to weak exports, weak consumption, global uncertainty and unfavorable financial conditions. Among other major EU economies, France is expected to grow 0.6% and 1.3% in 2026, Spain 2.6% and 2% in 2026. This year, Malta (+4.1%) and Ireland (+3.4%) will grow more than the others.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 09:54 AM\nSource:[ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/economia/2025/05/19/lue-taglia-la-stima-sul-pil-dellitalia-07-nel-2025-09-nel-2026_d384818e-bb75-476c-ae45-3af09b0e9117.html)\n\n**EU Revises Economic Growth Forecast Downward Due to Tariffs and Trade Uncertainty**\nThe European Commission has revised its forecast for the economic growth of the European Union (EU) for 2025 and 2026. The main reasons for the revision are the new import tariffs and increased uncertainty caused by the rapid changes in US trade policy. According to the report, the EU's GDP growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2025, down from the previous forecast of 1.5%. The forecast for 2026 has also been revised downward to 1.5% from 1.8%. However, the Commission expects the economic growth of the EU to accelerate to 1.5% in 2026, driven by an increase in consumption and investment. The inflation rate is expected to decrease faster than previously forecast, with consumer prices (HICP index) increasing by 2.3% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. The economy of the eurozone is expected to grow by 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, down from the previous forecasts of 1.3% and 1.6%. The unemployment rate in the EU is expected to remain at 5.9% in 2025 and decrease to 5.7% in 2026. In the eurozone, it is expected to decrease gradually from 6.4% in 2024 to 6.1% in 2026. The budget deficit of EU countries is expected to increase, with a deficit of 3.3% of GDP in 2025 and 3.4% in 2026. The public debt-to-GDP ratio in the EU is expected to reach 84.5% by 2026, up from 82% in 2024. The forecast for the GDP of individual countries has also been revised. Germany's economy is not expected to grow in 2025, but is expected to increase by 1.1% in 2026. France's GDP is expected to grow by 0.6% and 1.3%, Italy's by 0.7% and 0.9%, and Spain's by 2.6% and 2%.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 05:50 PM\nSource:[\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Neftegaz.ru](https://neftegaz.ru/news/finance/889150-ek-snizila-prognoz-rosta-vvp-es-na-2025-g-iz-za-poshlin-i-neopredelennosti/)\n\n**EU Economic Growth Projections Reduced Due to US Tariffs and Uncertainty**\nThe European Commission has lowered its economic growth projections for the European Union (EU) due to the impact of increased US tariffs and persistent uncertainty.

The Commission stated, 'This represents a considerable downward revision compared to the autumn 2024 projections, largely due to the impact of the tariff increase and the greater uncertainty caused by the recent abrupt changes in US commercial policy and the unpredictability of the final tariff configuration.' The eurozone, comprising 20 EU countries that share a single currency, is expected to grow at 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, also below previous estimates.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 01:09 PM\nSource:[\u65b0\u534e\u7f51](http://spanish.xinhuanet.com/20250519/6c76677b89494adea026e0870701be3b/c.html)\n\n**EU Economic Growth Projections Revised Downward**\nThe European Commission's 'European Economic Projections 2025 Spring' report has been published.

The growth forecast for the Eurozone has been revised from 1.3% to 0.9% for this year, while inflation is expected to continue its downward trend. The European Commission's '2025 Spring European Economic Forecasts' report states that the EU's economy is stronger than expected at the beginning of the year, but global trade tensions and uncertainties are slowing down growth. The report predicts that the EU's economy will grow by 1.1% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. For the Eurozone, the growth rate is expected to be 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. This is a significant decrease from the previous forecast of 1.3% and 1.6%. The revision is attributed to the slowdown in global trade flows and high levels of ongoing trade policy uncertainty. According to the report, Austria's economy is expected to shrink by 0.3% in 2025, while Germany's economy is expected to remain stagnant. France is expected to grow by 0.6%, Italy by 0.7%, and Spain by 2.6% in 2025, while in 2026, Germany is expected to grow by 1.1%, France by 1.3%, Italy by 0.9%, and Spain by 2%. Inflation is expected to be 2.3% in 2025 for the EU and 2.1% for the Eurozone, while in 2026, these rates are expected to decrease to 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively. The report also notes that the US's new tariffs have had a significant impact on global markets, and that the uncertainty surrounding trade policies has increased the pressure on the global economy, affecting the EU directly. The report concludes that the EU's exports will be slowed down by the global demand weakness, and that the trade tensions will continue to have a negative impact on the EU's economy. The report also warns that the commercial fragmentation can have negative effects on growth and that there is a risk of re-emerging inflationary pressures. The report also mentions Turkey's economy, stating that the country's economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2025 and 3.5% in 2026, due to the effects of tight monetary and fiscal policies, as well as the decline in energy prices. The report also predicts that Turkey's budget deficit will decrease and its public debt will remain at a reasonable level. European Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis stated in a press conference in Brussels that the European economy is resilient despite the increasing global uncertainties. He also stated that inflation has declined faster than expected and that growth will continue at a moderate pace. He warned that the risks are still downward and that the EU needs to take decisive steps to increase its competitiveness. 'The outlook is still subject to risks, and therefore, we need to take bold steps to increase our competitiveness within the EU.' he said. \nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 12:36 PM\nSource:[birgun.net](https://www.birgun.net/haber/ab-komisyonu-2025-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize-etti-624219)\n\n**EU Economy Losing Steam, Commissioner Warns**\nValdis Dombrovskis, European Commissioner for Economy, stated that the European economy is losing steam and that only swift action can prevent the EU from lagging behind global growth. The European Commission has revised down its growth forecasts for the European economy, in a scenario marked by global uncertainty and trade tensions, particularly with the US. 'Global uncertainty and tensions are weighing on the growth of the European Union', said Dombrovskis, highlighting that, despite the challenges, 'the European economy remains resilient'. The Commission now expects the EU's GDP to grow by only 1.1% in 2025, a downward revision of 0.7 percentage points from the previously forecast 1.5%, and projects an acceleration to 1.5% in 2026. In the Eurozone, growth will be 0.9% this year, rising to 1.4% next year. 'This downward revision of 0.7 percentage points in accumulated terms for 2025-26 is mainly due to the impact of the tariff increase and the uncertainty caused by the abrupt changes in US commercial policy', explained Dombrovskis. The Commissioner warned that 'tensions in trade between the US and the EU, and between the US and China, can depress GDP growth and rekindle inflationary pressures'. On the other hand, 'a relaxation of trade tensions or a faster expansion of EU trade can help sustain growth'. Dombrovskis emphasized that 'the moment for the EU to act is now.' The Commissioner pointed out that 'the deterioration of global trade as a central element of the cut in EU and global GDP growth forecasts.' 'The global growth outside the EU is now projected at 3.2% for 2025 and 2026, a downward revision of 0.4 percentage points from the autumn', revealed Dombrovskis. Despite the slowdown, the European labor market remains robust. 'More jobs are being created and real wages are rising. This means more Europeans working and more money in their pockets', said the Commissioner. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a new historical low of 5.7% in 2026, with the creation of an additional two million jobs by then. 'Tight labor markets and productivity recovery are supporting wage growth', he said, adding that 'real wages are expected to fully recover the lost purchasing power in most member states'. Inflation is decelerating more rapidly than expected in the European space, Dombrovskis noted. 'Inflation is falling faster than expected, driven by the decline in energy prices', he indicated, detailing that the rate in the euro area is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026. In the EU, inflation is expected to follow a similar trajectory, falling to 1.9% in 2026. 'Several factors are exerting downward pressure on inflation, including the appreciation of the euro and increased price competition in non-energy goods', he explained. On the investment side, the recovery will be 'more timid than expected', with gross fixed capital formation growing 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, after a contraction of 1.9% in 2024. 'High uncertainty and tight financial conditions continue to hold back investment', warned Dombrovskis, arguing that 'more investment means a more prosperous and competitive European economy'. In the chapter on public finances, the EU's budget deficit is expected to increase slightly to 3.3% of GDP in 2025, remaining at that level in 2026, while the debt ratio rises modestly due to the increase in financing costs and the slowdown in nominal growth. However, Dombrovskis clarified that 'the impact of the application of the national escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact, which can allow for greater expenditure in defense, is not yet reflected in the forecasts', he clarified.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 11:29 AM\nSource:[ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/05/19/o-momento-da-europa-para-agir-e-agora/)\n\n**EU Economic Growth Forecast Revised Downwards to 0.9% in 2025**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecast for the Eurozone to 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, down from 1.3% and 1.6% respectively in the previous forecast. The Commission attributes this to the weakening of global trade prospects and increased uncertainty over trade policies. 'The risks for the prospects are oriented downwards', says the European Commission. The Commission also notes that an additional fragmentation of global trade could mitigate economic growth and rekindle inflationary pressures. On the positive side, a further easing of tensions between the EU and the US or a faster expansion of EU trade with other countries could support EU growth. The EU economy has started 2025 on a slightly more solid basis than expected, according to the Commission, and will continue to grow at a moderate pace this year, with an acceleration expected in 2026, despite the increase in global economic uncertainty and trade tensions. Inflation is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 in the euro area. The EU's economic growth is expected to be similar, with a decline in inflation to just under 2% in 2026. The EU economy has recorded a growth of 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, above expectations, thanks to internal demand. This momentum has continued into the first quarter of 2025 (+0.3%). However, current forecasts revise downwards the growth prospects due to the worsening of global trade and political uncertainty. The global growth outside the EU is expected to be 3.2% in 2025-2026, down from 3.6% estimated in autumn. EU exports are expected to grow only 0.7% this year, driven by services. Investments, in a slight recovery after -1.8% in 2024, are expected to increase by 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, supported also by the Recovery Fund and the Cohesion Fund. Private consumption is expected to grow by 1.5% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. The labor market remains solid: 1.7 million jobs created in 2024, with an additional 2 million expected. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a historic low of 5.7% in 2026. Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said, 'The uncertainty on the global economic policy has reached levels never seen since the Covid-19 pandemic.' He added, 'The logic behind the US announcements on tariffs is unpredictable and apparently arbitrary, and has led to unprecedented levels of uncertainty on the global economic policy.' 'Since January, the new US administration has increased tariffs on imports from an increasing number of partner countries and on specific goods. The average tariff rate applied by the US on imports is today higher than at any other time since the 1930s.' 'The US announcements in April have also caused very high levels of market volatility. This market volatility remains high and the sentiment is fragile, as a great uncertainty on US trade and economic policy still looms,' he concluded.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 10:47 AM\nSource:[Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/news/dazi_ue_riduce_stime_pil_cosa_succede-8845536.html)\n\n**European Commission Revises Down Economic Growth Forecasts for Eurozone**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecasts for the Eurozone downwards.

The EU economy grew by 0.4% in the last quarter of 2024, driven by a robust internal demand. However, the first quarter of 2025 saw a growth of only 0.3% in real GDP. The Commission's spring forecasts are based on some assumptions about tariffs. 'In the model, it was assumed that the tariffs on US imports of goods from the EU and almost all other trading partners would remain at 10%, the level applied on April 9, except for the higher tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars (25%) and the tariff exemptions on some products (pharmaceuticals and microprocessors). It was assumed that the bilateral tariffs between the US and China would be lower than those applied on April 9, but high enough to lead to a significant reduction in bilateral trade in goods between the US and China. The tariffs agreed upon by China and the US on May 12 turned out to be lower than those assumed, but still high enough to not invalidate the assumption of a negative impact on trade relations between the US and China.' As a result, global growth outside the EU is now expected to be 3.2% for both 2025 and 2026, down from the 3.6% expected in the autumn of 2024. 'This downward revision reflects in large part a weakening of prospects for both the US and China. The slowdown in global trade is even more marked.' Consequently, the Commission expects EU exports to grow only 0.7% this year, with a new contraction in goods exports partially offset by the resilience of service exports, which are less influenced by trade tensions. In 2026, export growth is expected to accelerate to 2.1%. The uncertainty of tariffs also weighs on internal demand and investment. 'As for private consumption, a slightly more robust growth is expected than in the autumn', supported 'by a still resilient labor market.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 09:09 AM\nSource:[SIR - Servizio Informazione Religiosa](https://www.agensir.it/quotidiano/2025/5/19/commissione-ue-previsioni-economiche-prospettive-peggiorate-i-dazi-pesano-sul-commercio-internazionale/)\n\n**EU Trade Commissioner: EU's Economic Growth Forecast Remains Pessimistic**\nEuropean Commission Executive Vice President and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis stated that the recent trade truce between the US and China, which involves a mutual reduction of tariffs, is a step in the right direction, but the high tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese products still pose a significant risk. The EU has been concerned that China may divert its exports from the US to the EU due to the high tariffs, which could have a negative impact on the EU's economic growth and investment prospects. Dombrovskis emphasized that the EU's economic growth forecast for this year remains pessimistic due to the uncertainty caused by the US tariffs. The EU will release its spring economic forecast on May 19, which is expected to revise downward its GDP growth forecast for this year. The EU's previous forecast in autumn last year predicted a 0.9% GDP growth rate for this year and 1.5% for next year. However, the forecast is expected to be revised downward due to the impact of US tariffs.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 13, 2025 11:32 PM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E5%9B%BD%E9%99%85/20250513-%E6%AC%A7%E7%9B%9F%E8%B4%B8%E6%98%93%E4%B8%93%E5%91%98-%E6%AC%A7%E7%9B%9F%E4%BB%8A%E5%B9%B4%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E5%A2%9E%E9%95%BF%E9%A2%84%E6%9C%9F%E4%BB%8D%E6%82%B2%E8%A7%82)\n\n**EU Economic Growth Forecast Revised Down Amid US Tariffs Concerns**\nThe European Commission's Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis has expressed optimism about the US-China trade truce, saying it is a step in the right direction, but notes that US tariffs remain high, which will likely lead to a pessimistic economic growth forecast for this year. The European Commission will release its spring economic forecast data next Monday, and Dombrovskis has announced that it will revise down its annual economic growth rate forecast for this year. The Commission's economic predictions are released twice a year, and last autumn's prediction was a 0.9% growth rate for the EU's GDP in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025. However, due to the impact of US tariffs, the prediction will be significantly revised. Dombrovskis said that the EU economy had a stronger foundation at the end of last year than initially expected, and maintained its momentum at the beginning of this year, but US tariffs and the uncertainty they bring will have a negative impact on the EU's economic growth and investment prospects this year. He also noted that the EU's concerns about trade diversion, where countries may shift their exports from the US to the EU due to high US tariffs, have been slightly alleviated by the US-China trade truce, but the risk remains, and the Commission has announced that it will release a report on trade diversion risks in May.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 13, 2025 04:18 PM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5599/8738001)\n\n**IMF Downgrades Global Economic Forecast Due to Trade Tensions and Political Uncertainty**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its forecast for the global economy downward, citing the impact of trade tensions and high levels of political uncertainty. The IMF predicts that the global GDP will grow at 2.8% in 2025 and 3% in 2026, down from the previous forecast of 3.3% for both years. This represents a revision of five-tenths of a percentage point downward for this year and three-tenths of a percentage point for next year. The IMF notes that the rapid escalation of trade tensions and extremely high levels of political uncertainty will have a significant impact on the global economy. The US economy is expected to grow at 1.8% in 2025, down from the previous forecast of 2.7%, due to the impact of tariffs and a weaker-than-expected increase in consumption. The IMF also reduced its forecast for China's GDP, predicting a growth rate of 4% in 2025 and 2026, down from the previous forecast of 5% and 5.3% respectively. The IMF also reduced its forecast for the eurozone, predicting a growth rate of 0.8% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026. However, the IMF notes that the Spanish economy is expected to grow at 2.5% in 2025, up from the previous forecast of 2.3%, due to a strong performance in 2024 and the reconstruction efforts after the floods in Valencia last October. 'The increase in uncertainty and tariffs are the main drivers of the weak growth in 2025', said the IMF. 'However, there are several factors that will compensate for that scenario and drive the modest rebound in growth in 2026, such as a stronger consumption due to the increase in real wages and the relaxation of fiscal rules in Germany.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: April 22, 2025 01:00 PM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/invertia/economia/macroeconomia/20250422/fmi-aplica-gran-recorte-economia-baja-decimas-pib-mundial-eeuu-solo-mejora-espana/1003743723998_0.html)\n\n**UK Downgrades 2025 Economic Growth Forecast to 1%**\nThe UK government has significantly lowered its economic growth forecast for 2025 to 1%, a drastic cut from the 2% prediction made in October last year. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) attributed the downward revision to increased global economic uncertainty, rising energy prices, higher government debt costs, and sluggish domestic productivity growth. UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak expressed dissatisfaction with the current economic growth data, emphasizing that the government will continue to implement long-term strategies to promote economic growth and improve living standards. The OBR predicts that the UK's economic growth rate will rebound to 1.9% in 2026, followed by a steady 1.7% to 1.8% growth rate from 2027 to 2029. The OBR also warned that uncertainty surrounding US trade policies could significantly impact the UK economy. If global trade disputes escalate and lead to a 20% increase in tariffs between the US and Europe, the UK's GDP could contract by 1%, resulting in a near-zero fiscal surplus.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 26, 2025 10:31 PM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202503273357173521.html)\n\n**OECD revises global economic growth forecast downward**\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has revised its forecast for global economic growth, predicting a slowdown from 3.2% in 2024 to 3.1% in 2025 and 3.0% in 2026. The OECD attributed the downward revision to 'increased trade barriers in several G20 economies and greater geopolitical and policy uncertainty weighing on investment and household spending.' The organization warned that a further increase in trade barriers would hinder global growth and contribute to inflationary pressures. According to the OECD, the US economy is expected to grow at 2.2% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026, with the implementation of tariffs. The eurozone is expected to grow at 1% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026, with increased uncertainty moderating the expansion. Germany, France, and Italy are expected to experience economic growth below 1% in 2025, while Spain is expected to grow at 2.6% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. The OECD also expects inflation to remain higher than previously anticipated, but to moderate as economic growth slows. In the G20 economies, inflation is expected to decrease from 3.8% in 2025 to 3.2% in 2026. In the eurozone, inflation is expected to decrease from 2.3% in 2024 to 2.2% in 2025 and 2% in 2026. However, in the US, inflation is expected to increase from 2.5% in 2024 to 2.8% in 2025. The OECD warned that a resurgence of inflation or slower-than-expected economic growth could generate volatility in financial markets. It also warned that new bilateral tariffs and increasing geopolitical and policy uncertainty would weigh on business investment and trade, while the increase in trade costs could exert greater upward pressure on consumer prices. 'Growing protectionism, geopolitical uncertainty, and weak growth prospects reinforce the need for ambitious structural reforms to ensure the health of internal markets,' the OECD added.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 12:28 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u534e\u7f51](http://spanish.xinhuanet.com/20250318/6d14e583b4914a6a8567a3552912cf1a/c.html)\n\n**OECD revises global economic growth forecast downward for 2025**\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has revised its forecast for global economic growth in 2025 downward, citing uncertainty and tensions in the global economy. 'We are navigating turbulent waters', said Alvaro Santos Pereira, the OECD's chief economist, summarizing the global economic situation. The OECD now predicts a 3.1% growth in the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2025, down from its previous forecast of 3.3% in December. The United States, which has threatened to engage in a trade war with its main trading partners, is expected to grow by 2.2% this year and 1.6% next year, according to the OECD. The organization has lowered its forecast for US economic growth in 2025 and 2026 by 0.2 and 0.5 percentage points, respectively. The aggressive trade policies pursued by the US are particularly affecting its neighbors, Canada and Mexico, whose growth forecasts have plummeted: Canada's growth is expected to be 0.7% in 2025, down from 2.3% in December, while Mexico is expected to enter a recession this year, according to the OECD. The OECD attributes the downward revision to the ongoing trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties affecting many countries. The OECD notes that the growth in the US, Mexico, and Canada 'will slow down as tariffs come into effect'. The organization has only taken into account the new tariffs between the US, Canada, and Mexico, as well as the tariffs on steel and aluminum, but not the threatened reciprocal tariffs mentioned by Trump or those related to the European Union. Despite this, the OECD has revised its growth forecast for 2025 downward for Germany and France, the largest and second-largest economies in the eurozone, for the second consecutive time. The OECD now expects Germany's GDP to grow by 0.4% this year, down from 0.7% in its previous forecast, while France's growth is expected to be 0.8% this year, 0.1 percentage points less than in December. 'European economies will suffer fewer direct economic effects' from the trade measures included in the OECD's projections, 'but the increase in geopolitical and political uncertainty should, nonetheless, slow down growth', explains the organization. Only Spain is expected to experience sustained growth, with a forecast of 2.6% in 2025. Japan's growth forecast for 2025 has also been revised downward to 1.1%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease. China's growth is expected to reach 4.8% in 2025, with little change from the December forecast. 'The negative consequences of the imposition of tariffs are largely offset by the adoption of reinforced support measures', notes the OECD. The OECD warns of the negative impact of trade tensions on global trade, which could not only slow down global production but also exacerbate inflation.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 11:55 AM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/agencias/2025/03/17/la-ocde-revisa-a-la-baja-el-crecimiento-mundial-en-2025-en-un-contexto-de-tensiones-comerciales-208735)\n\n**ECB's Macroeconomic Projections for the Euro Area: Uncertainty and Challenges Ahead**\nAccording to the European Central Bank's (ECB) macroeconomic projections for the euro area, the high uncertainty surrounding the geopolitical situation and economic and trade policies will negatively impact the expected economic growth. This is a consequence of the slightly weaker-than-expected economic growth at the end of 2024. The uncertainty related to both internal and external policies is high. Although the baseline projections only take into account the impact of new US-China trade tariffs, it is assumed that the negative effects of uncertainty related to possible further changes in global trade policies, especially towards the European Union, will affect exports and investments in the euro area. It is estimated that, combined with the ongoing challenges in terms of competitiveness, this will lead to a further decline in the euro area's share of export markets. Despite these unfavorable factors, the conditions remain in place for a renewed increase in the dynamics of GDP in the euro area in the projection horizon. It is expected that the growth will be driven by rising real wages and employment growth - with a strong, albeit slowing, labor market - and that consumption will remain a key driver of growth. The internal demand is expected to support the easing of financing conditions, reflected in market expectations of the future path of interest rates. The labor market is expected to remain resilient - with an average unemployment rate of 6.3% in 2025, followed by a decline to 6.2% in 2027. It is projected that productivity will grow in line with the fading of some cyclical factors that have weakened its dynamics in recent periods. However, structural problems persist. Overall, the average annual growth rate of real GDP is expected to be 0.9% in 2025, followed by an increase to 1.2% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027. Compared to the ECB's macroeconomic projections from December 2024, the prospects for GDP growth in 2025 and 2026 have been revised down by 0.2 percentage points, but the 2027 projection remains unchanged. The weaker prospects are mainly due to a downward revision of exports and, to a lesser extent, a downward revision of investment projections. These revisions reflect the stronger-than-expected impact of uncertainty and expectations that the challenges related to competitiveness will persist longer than previously expected. \nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/projections/html/ecb.projections202503_ecbstaff~106050a4fa.pl.html)\n\n**Lagarde: Economic Uncertainty Weighs on Exports and Investments**\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde stated, 'The downward revisions to the euro area's GDP growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 reflect the decline in exports and the continued weakness in investments, partly due to the high uncertainty surrounding commercial and economic policies.'

European Commissioner for Trade, Valdis Dombrovskis, warned that the international environment is becoming increasingly unpredictable. 'In general, we expect the EU economy to grow at a slower pace compared to what we projected in our autumn forecast', he said. The EU had previously forecasted a 0.9% growth in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025, but according to Eurostat, the actual growth rate is expected to be 0.9% in 2024. Dombrovskis emphasized that the uncertainty is 'high' and has increased significantly, particularly due to US trade policies, which 'limits investment and reduces external perspectives' for the European economy. He also noted that energy prices have increased again in recent months, affecting the economy's performance. 'However, despite all these challenges, the conditions for a gradual recovery of growth momentum throughout this year continue', he said. The Commissioner urged the Eurozone to prepare for an increasingly unpredictable international environment. 'We will need to make full use of our strengths and address our weaknesses with the utmost urgency. We will have to take more responsibility for our security and defense and improve our competitiveness and economic fundamentals', he listed. The European Commissioner also indicated that the Finance Ministers of the Eurozone countries have endorsed the fiscal orientation that should guide the member states. 'This year's recommendation emphasizes the urgent need to address the lagging productivity and innovation, highlighting the importance of continuing our efforts to increase the competitiveness of the Eurozone', he stressed. The recommendation also places a strong emphasis on the need to strengthen the Single Market.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 08:15 PM\nSource:[ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/02/17/mais-pessimista-sobre-crescimento-bruxelas-avisa-para-ambiente-internacional-imprevisivel/)\n\n**Eurozone Growth Predictions Revised Downward**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth predictions for the eurozone, stating that growth will be slightly lower than previously expected. According to Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis, the uncertainty surrounding the international scenario has increased, citing the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the potential for US President Donald Trump to impose tariffs. Pierre Gramegna, executive director of the European Stability Mechanism, noted that tariffs would make predictions even more unpredictable. The Commission has not released specific numbers, but estimates suggest a potential 0.1-0.2% decrease in growth for the EU and eurozone. The revised predictions for 2025 are 1.5% for the EU and 1.3% for the eurozone, down from previous estimates.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 06:18 PM\nSource:[eunews.it](https://www.eunews.it/2025/02/17/eurozona-crescita-piu-bassa-del-previsto/)\n\n\n\n\n# FORECASTS\n\n## R1: Forecaster 1 Reasoning\n(a) The Autumn 2025 forecast is likely around six months away, so that is when we will know the outcome.  \n(b) As of now, the Commission\u2019s official line for 2026 remains 1.5% with no announced decrease, so the status quo outcome is No.  \n(c) A No outcome could occur if the Autumn 2025 figure remains above 1.3% (for instance, dropping from 1.5% to 1.4%) or if no explicit mention of trade uncertainty is made.  \n(d) A Yes outcome would require the 2026 forecast to be at or below 1.3% and an explicit attribution to trade uncertainty and tariffs.  \n\nProbability: 60%  \n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 2 Reasoning\n(a) There are roughly six months to go until the usual publication window for the Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast, so the resolution is still pending.  \n(b) If nothing changed, the Commission would leave its 2026 EU GDP growth forecast at 1.5%, meaning no 0.2-point downgrade and thus a \u201cNo\u201d outcome.  \n(c) A plausible \u201cNo\u201d scenario: The Commission lowers 2026 growth only slightly, say to 1.4%, or even keeps it at 1.5%, and thus fails to meet the 0.2-point revision threshold. Even if trade tensions are mentioned, the numerical criterion would not be satisfied.  \n(d) A plausible \u201cYes\u201d scenario: We see mounting trade disruptions, enough for the Commission to cut the 2026 outlook to 1.3% (or below), explicitly citing ongoing tariff and policy uncertainty as part of the rationale.  \n\nGiven that forecasts often move gradually, and 0.2% is a moderate but not huge shift, the probability that both conditions are met is neither negligible nor overwhelming. After weighing present uncertainties and the Commission\u2019s stated concerns about trade tensions, I estimate:  \n\nProbability: 60%  \n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 3 Reasoning\n(a) Time left until we know: Around six months remain, as the Autumn 2025 Forecast is typically released in November.  \n(b) Status quo outcome: Right now, the Commission\u2019s baseline for 2026 is still 1.5% growth, with trade tensions acknowledged but not yet prompting a downward revision below 1.3%.  \n(c) A likely No scenario: The Commission revises 2026 growth modestly downward (e.g., 1.4%), or fails to list trade uncertainty among the primary reasons for the revision, so the 0.2 percentage-point drop and explicit mention of trade risk do not both materialize.  \n(d) A likely Yes scenario: Global trade frictions deepen (e.g., further tariff escalations), prompting the Commission to cut the 2026 forecast to 1.3% or below and explicitly cite these heightened trade risks as a key factor driving the revision.  \n\nProbability: 65%  \n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 4 Reasoning\n(a) The Autumn 2025 forecast is typically released in early November, so there are about five to six months left before we know the official outcome.\n\n(b) Currently, the Commission\u2019s 2026 forecast stands at 1.5%. If nothing significant changes in trade policy or the broader outlook, the Commission might leave it at 1.5% or revise only slightly above 1.3%, and/or not explicitly cite trade uncertainty as a key reason.\n\n(c) A scenario yielding a No: Trade frictions calm down or remain marginal, so the EU Commission sees little change to the medium-term outlook and revises 2026 growth only slightly\u2014say, to 1.4%\u2014with minimal mention of tariffs or trade uncertainty.\n\n(d) A scenario yielding a Yes: Trade tensions worsen (e.g., more US-EU tariffs or broader spillovers), weakening external demand enough that the Commission cuts the 2026 EU growth forecast to 1.3% or below and points to trade-policy risks as a central driver of that downgrade.\n\nProbability: 60%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 5 Reasoning\n(a) We have about half a year to go (roughly six months) until the Autumn 2025 forecast is released, which is when the question will be definitively answered.\n\n(b) Under a status quo scenario with little further escalation in tariffs or new shocks, the European Commission might maintain its current 1.5% estimate for 2026 or revise only slightly (e.g., to 1.4%), thereby falling short of the 0.2-point decrease criterion.\n\n(c) A \u201cNo\u201d outcome would occur if, for instance, the Commission\u2019s Autumn 2025 update lowers the 2026 forecast only to around 1.4%, or even 1.3% but omits explicit mention of trade/tariff uncertainty. Alternatively, they may leave the 2026 forecast unchanged at 1.5%, citing other factors (e.g., domestic demand or fiscal policies) rather than trade tensions.\n\n(d) A \u201cYes\u201d outcome would occur if the Commission lowers the 2026 forecast to 1.3% or below (e.g., 1.2%) and explicitly blames trade policy disruptions or tariffs as a key contributor. Continued US-EU tariff escalation or significant trade uncertainty would almost certainly prompt that downgrade and clear mention of its trade-related causes.\n\nProbability: 70%\n\n",

The Commission urges decisive actions to enhance the EU's competitiveness.\n\n**Sources:**\n*   [HABERTURK.COM](https://www.haberturk.com/ab-2025-yili-ekonomik-buyume-tahminini-dusurdu-3792233-ekonomi)\n*   [birgun.net](https://www.birgun.net/haber/ab-komisyonu-2025-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize-etti-624219)\n*   [ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/05/19/o-momento-da-europa-para-agir-e-agora/)\n*   [Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/news/dazi_ue_riduce_stime_pil_cosa_succede-8845536.html)\n*   [ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/economia/2025/05/19/lue-taglia-la-stima-sul-pil-dellitalia-07-nel-2025-09-nel-2026_d384818e-bb75-476c-ae45-3af09b0e9117.html)\n*   [\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Neftegaz.ru](https://neftegaz.ru/news/finance/889150-ek-snizila-prognoz-rosta-vvp-es-na-2025-g-iz-za-poshlin-i-neopredelennosti/)\n*   [\u65b0\u534e\u7f51 (Xinhuanet Spanish)](http://spanish.xinhuanet.com/20250519/6c76677b89494adea026e0870701be3b/c.html)\n*   [Son Dakika](https://www.sondakika.com/ekonomi/haber-ab-ekonomi-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize--18648430/)\n*   [Il Fatto Quotidiano](https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2025/05/19/commissione-europea-stime-crescita-italia-notizie/7993760/)\n*   [SIR - Servizio Informazione Religiosa](https://www.agensir.it/quotidiano/2025/5/19/commissione-ue-previsioni-economiche-prospettive-peggiorate-i-dazi-pesano-sul-commercio-internazionale/)\n*   [RFI (Chinese)](https://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E5%9B%BD%E9%99%85/20250513-%E6%AC%A7%E7%9B%9F%E8%B4%B8%E6%98%93%E4%B8%93%E5%91%98-%E6%AC%A7%E7%9B%9F%E4%BB%8A%E5%B9%B4%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E5%A2%9E%E9%95%BF%E9%A2%84%E6%9C%9F%E4%BB%8D%E6%82%B2%E8%A7%82)\n*   [Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2 (UDN Money)](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5599/8738001)\n*   [El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/invertia/economia/macroeconomia/20250422/fmi-aplica-gran-recorte-economia-baja-decimas-pib-mundial-eeuu-solo-mejora-espana/1003743723998_0.html)\n*   [\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51 (East Money)](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202503273357173521.html)\n*   [\u65b0\u534e\u7f51 (Xinhuanet Spanish, OECD)](http://spanish.xinhuanet.com/20250318/6d14e583b4914a6a8567a3552912cf1a/c.html)\n*   [LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/agencias/2025/03/17/la-ocde-revisa-a-la-baja-el-crecimiento-mundial-en-2025-en-un-contexto-de-tensiones-comerciales-208735)\n*   [European Central Bank (Polish)](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/projections/html/ecb.projections202503_ecbstaff~106050a4fa.pl.html)\n*   [Quotidiano Libero](https://www.liberoquotidiano.it/video/video-news-by-vista/41805230/lagarde-bce-incertezza-politiche-commerciali-pesa-su-export-e-investimenti.html)\n*   [ECO (earlier article)](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/02/17/mais-pessimista-sobre-crescimento-bruxelas-avisa-para-ambiente-internacional-imprevisivel/)\n*   [eunews.it](https://www.eunews.it/2025/02/17/eurozona-crescita-piu-bassa-del-previsto/)\n\n**Forecaster Reasoning Highlights:**\nThe forecasters generally agree that the outcome depends on events in the next six months, particularly regarding trade tensions.\n\n*   **Status Quo:** If nothing significant changes, the Commission might not revise the 2026 forecast down by the required 0.2 percentage points, or might not explicitly cite trade uncertainty.\n*   **\"No\" Scenario:** Trade frictions could ease, or remain marginal, leading to only a slight revision (e.g., to 1.4%) or no explicit mention of trade uncertainty as a primary cause.\n*   **\"Yes\" Scenario:** Worsening trade tensions (e.g., more US-EU tariffs) could lead the Commission to cut the 2026 forecast to 1.3% or below, explicitly citing these trade-related risks.\n\nThe consensus is that there's a moderate chance (60-70%) that both conditions (the 0.2 percentage point downward revision and the explicit citation of trade uncertainty) will be met.Okay, I've completed all the steps you requested!\n\n**Step 1: Generate a number of random topics**\nI generated a list of random headlines.\n\n**Step 2: Pick one**\nI selected the topic: \"EU lowers economic growth expectations due to global trade uncertainty.\"\n\n**Step 3: Decompose this topic into sub-questions**\nI broke down the topic into five specific, forecastable questions and provided research context.\n\n**Step 4: Operationalize this question**\nI took the first sub-question: \"Will the European Commission's Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast revise the EU's 2026 real GDP growth forecast downwards by at least 0.2 percentage points compared to the Spring 2025 forecast (1.4% for Eurozone, 1.5% for EU), explicitly citing \"trade uncertainty,\" \"tariffs,\" or \"protectionism\" as a primary reason?\" and operationalized it into a detailed, binary forecast question.\n\n**Step 5: Forecast the question**\nI successfully forecasted the operationalized question. The final prediction is **60.0% probability** that the European Commission's Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast will revise the EU's 2026 real GDP growth forecast downwards by at least 0.2 percentage points compared to the Spring 2025 forecast, explicitly citing trade uncertainty as a contributing factor.\n\nThe research indicates that the European Commission has already revised growth projections downward for 2025 and 2026 in its Spring 2025 forecast due to global trade tensions, particularly US tariffs. The EU's 2026 growth forecast was revised from 1.8% down to 1.5% in the Spring. For the question to resolve as \"Yes,\" a further downward revision to 1.3% or lower in the Autumn 2025 forecast, with trade uncertainty explicitly cited, would be needed. Forecasters believe there is a 60% chance of this occurring.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?",

Bank runs are publicly understood economic phenomena. Individual/small community: If a trusted community receives a high-probability forecast, some members might preemptively withdraw funds[2](https://www.anticipation-hub.org/learn/emerging-topics/impact-based-forecasting)[5](https://www.forecast-based-financing.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Impact-based-forecasting-guide-2020.pdf). However, individual actions alone rarely trigger systemic bank runs. Society-level: Public knowledge of a high-probability forecast could create panic withdrawals through social contagion[5](https://www.forecast-based-financing.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Impact-based-forecasting-guide-2020.pdf), directly causing the predicted outcome (as seen in historical bank runs). This meets the \"toilet paper shortage\" precedent from the examples. Reframing: Alternatives focus on measurable economic indicators (liquidity ratios, unemployment data) that influence bank stability without directly predicting panic behavior[1](https://www.meted.ucar.edu/ibf/hazards/print.php)[3](https://www.meted.ucar.edu/emgmt/hazwx/navmenu.php?tab=3&page=4-5-0&type=flash). These avoid self-referential loops while preserving forecast utility. This analysis assumes moderate public trust in forecasting platforms comparable to mainstream media credibility.\n",

Individual/Small Community: If John Doe or associates see a forecast suggesting high success likelihood, it could incentivize the attempt. Conversely, a low-probability prediction might deter it, creating a self-fulfilling dynamic[2](https://www.anticipation-hub.org/learn/emerging-topics/impact-based-forecasting)[4](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6ur8vDX6ApAXrRN3t/information-hazards-why-you-should-care-and-what-you-can-do). Society-level: Widespread knowledge of such forecasts could normalize robbery attempts or inspire copycats, though the impact is limited by the specificity of the named individuals[1](https://www.meted.ucar.edu/ibf/hazards/print.php)[5](https://www.forecast-based-financing.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Impact-based-forecasting-guide-2020.pdf).

Historical examples show technical knowledge about hazards requires careful dissemination[1](https://www.meted.ucar.edu/ibf/hazards/print.php)[5](https://www.forecast-based-financing.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Impact-based-forecasting-guide-2020.pdf). Individual-level self-fulfilling: If a motivated individual/group learns their chosen method (e.g., Option X) has high success probability, they might accelerate development[4](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6ur8vDX6ApAXrRN3t/information-hazards-why-you-should-care-and-what-you-can-do). However, nuclear-level weapons typically require state-level resources, limiting individual impact. Society-level self-fulfilling: Public knowledge of feasible superweapon methods could trigger arms races between nations[2](https://www.anticipation-hub.org/learn/emerging-topics/impact-based-forecasting)[5](https://www.forecast-based-financing.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Impact-based-forecasting-guide-2020.pdf), as seen in historical WMD proliferation patterns.

At a societal level, widespread knowledge of such forecasts could normalize robbery attempts.\n\n**Potential Alternative Questions**:\n*   What percentage of robbery attempts in [specific location/context] succeed under current security conditions?\n*   Will reported robbery success rates in [region] decrease by \u226510% in 2026 compared to 2025?\n*   How many security upgrades will Mr. FooBar implement in the next 6 months?\n\n### 3. What are the chances of each of the following allowing me to invent a weapon more powerful than our most powerful nuke? [Option X, Y, Z]\n\n*   **Is Harmful**: Yes\n*   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for individual**: Kinda Yes\n*   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for society**: Yes\n\n**Reasoning**: This is a significant information hazard because it could guide resources and research towards developing catastrophic weapons, potentially triggering an arms race.\n\n**Potential Alternative Questions**:\n*   How many new weapons surpassing current nuclear yields will be developed globally by 2040?\n*   What percentage of nations will ratify treaties banning weapons exceeding nuclear yields by 2030?\n*   Will peer-reviewed journals publish more than 10 papers on theoretical superweapon physics in 2026?\n\n### 4. Will AI cause a disaster that results in > 1 million deaths before 2030?\n\n*   **Is Harmful**: Kinda Yes\n*   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for individual**: Kinda Yes\n*   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for society**: Yes\n\n**Reasoning**: A \"Yes\" answer could motivate accelerationist groups or state actors to pursue dangerous AI capabilities. A high-probability forecast could trigger preemptive military AI development, while a low-probability one might reduce safety funding.\n\n**Potential Alternative Questions**:\n*   Will global AI safety research funding exceed $10B before 2030?\n*   How many peer-reviewed papers about AI alignment will be published by 2028?\n*   What percentage of AI labs will implement third-party model audits by 2027?\n\n### 5. Who will win March Madness next year?\n\n*   **Is Harmful**: No\n*   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for individual**: No\n*   **Self-fulfilling/defeating for society**: No\n\n**Reasoning**: This is a low-stakes question. While predictions might influence betting markets, they are unlikely to affect the actual outcome of the games.\n\n**Potential Alternative Questions**:\n*   Which team will have the highest average points per game in March Madness next year?\n*   What percentage of #1 seeded teams will reach the Final Four next year?\n*   How many games in next year's March Madness will be decided by 3 points or fewer?",

U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)**\n- **Primary Source**: The BEA offers the most comprehensive U.S. GDP data, including:\n  - **National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) Historical Tables**: Annual and quarterly GDP data, revisions, and detailed breakdowns (e.g., consumption, investment, government spending)[2](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product)[9](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=147&step=2).\n  - **GDP by Industry**: Historical industry-specific contributions to GDP, available via a downloadable ZIP file[9](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=147&step=2).\n  - **Interactive Data Tools**: Customizable tables for filtering and exporting data[2](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product).\n\n### **2. Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)**\n- **Key Features**:\n  - **Nominal GDP**: Quarterly data in billions of dollars (seasonally adjusted annual rate), updated through Q1 2025[1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP).\n  - **Real GDP**: Inflation-adjusted data in chained 2017 dollars, with historical records back to 1947[4](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1).\n  - **Export Options**: Downloadable in CSV, Excel, or other formats directly from the FRED platform[1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP)[4](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1).\n\n### **3. World Bank Open Data**\n- **Global Context**: Provides U.S. GDP in current US dollars alongside international comparisons. Data is licensed under CC BY-4.0 for reuse[3](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US)[8](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD).\n\n### **4. Macrotrends & Trading Economics**\n- **Supplementary Sources**:\n  - **Macrotrends**: Annual GDP figures from 1960 to 2023 in a simplified chart format[7](https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/usa/united-states/gdp-gross-domestic-product).\n  - **Trading Economics**: Offers historical data, forecasts, and GDP growth rate details, though it primarily aggregates from the BEA and World Bank[5](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp)[6](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth).\n\n---\n\n**Recommended Workflow**:\n1. **For detailed U.S. economic analysis**: Use the BEA\u2019s NIPA tables[2](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product) or FRED\u2019s real GDP series[4](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1).\n2. **For international comparisons**: Download World Bank datasets[3](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US)[8](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD).\n3. **For industry-specific insights**: Access the BEA\u2019s GDP-by-Industry ZIP file[9](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=147&step=2).\n\n---\n\n\n\nTool output:\n\nThe US GDP forecast for 2027 projects moderate economic growth, with real GDP expected to expand by **1.8%** annually, according to key institutions like the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Federal Reserve[1](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61136)[2](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=326)[6](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20250319.pdf). Nominal GDP is anticipated to reach approximately **$29.2 trillion** (Trading Economics) to **$32.9 trillion** (Statista), depending on the methodology and inflation adjustments[5](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp)[7](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263591/gross-domestic-product-gdp-of-the-united-states/).\n\n### Key Projections:\n**Real GDP Growth:**\n- **1.8% annual growth** in 2027, consistent across CBO, Federal Reserve, and IMF projections[1](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61136)[2](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=326)[6](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20250319.pdf)[9](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/profile/USA).  \n- This follows slightly higher growth rates of 1.9% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026[1](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61136)[6](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20250319.pdf).\n\n**Nominal GDP:**\n- **$29.2 trillion** (Trading Economics)[5](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp) and **$32.9 trillion** (Statista)[7](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263591/gross-domestic-product-gdp-of-the-united-states/), reflecting differences in inflation assumptions or measurement frameworks.  \n- The CBO\u2019s long-term model suggests steady growth, with nominal GDP rising from $28.2 trillion in 2023 to $41.7 trillion by 2033[3](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216985/forecast-of-us-gross-domestic-product/).\n\n**Supporting Factors:**\n- The Federal Reserve\u2019s March 2025 projections highlight a stable unemployment rate of **4.3%** and controlled inflation (PCE inflation at **2.0%**) by 2027[2](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=326)[6](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20250319.pdf).  \n- Deloitte\u2019s analysis aligns with this outlook, forecasting a gradual slowdown in growth to **1.9% annually** post-2026[8](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/us-economic-forecast/united-states-outlook-analysis.html).\n\n### Risks and Context:\n- These projections assume no major economic shocks and continued stability in labor markets and monetary policy[2](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=326)[6](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20250319.pdf).  \n- Differences in nominal GDP estimates stem from varying inflation expectations and methodological approaches[5](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp)[7](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263591/gross-domestic-product-gdp-of-the-united-states/).\n\nIn summary, the US economy is expected to grow steadily but modestly through 2027, with real growth anchored near 1.8% and nominal GDP expanding to between $29 trillion and $33 trillion.\n\n---\n\n\n\nTool call:

The primary dataset used is the \"Real Gross Domestic Product\" (GDPC1) data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database. This dataset contains quarterly, seasonally adjusted real GDP values in billions of chained 2017 dollars, from 1947 to the present. The data was downloaded as a CSV file from the official FRED website at the following URL: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1).\n\nTo forecast the US GDP for 2027, two distinct modeling approaches were employed: a Monte Carlo simulation of a Geometric Brownian Motion and a Linear Regression on the logarithm of the historical GDP data. The Monte Carlo simulation, which is a more conservative model, yielded the following quantiles for 2027 GDP: the 10th percentile at \\$23.41 trillion, the 25th percentile at \\$23.63 trillion, the median (50th percentile) at \\$23.88 trillion, the 75th percentile at \\$24.14 trillion, and the 90th percentile at \\$24.39 trillion. In contrast, the Linear Regression model, which assumes a constant growth rate and is therefore more optimistic, predicted significantly higher values. For this model, the 10th percentile for 2027 GDP is \\$26.39 trillion, the 25th percentile is \\$27.63 trillion, the median is \\$29.09 trillion, the 75th percentile is \\$30.61 trillion, and the 90th percentile is \\$32.06 trillion. An attempt to use a third model, ARIMA, was unsuccessful.\n\nThe significant difference in the forecasts highlights the uncertainty inherent in economic predictions and the sensitivity of these predictions to the underlying model assumptions. The Linear Regression model extrapolates the long-term historical growth trend, which has been consistently positive. The Monte Carlo simulation, on the other hand, incorporates historical volatility, which results in a wider range of potential outcomes and a more conservative estimate. The historical data shows a consistent upward trend in US Real GDP, which justifies the use of forecasting models that project future growth.
